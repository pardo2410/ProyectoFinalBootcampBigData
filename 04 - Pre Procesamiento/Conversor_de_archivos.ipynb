      "the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their \n",

      "28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General \n",
      "Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the \n",

      "resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was \n",
      "convened and has continued to act. In t his regard, it has been said, first, that \n",
      "\"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that \n",

      "before the adoption b y the General Assembly of resolution ES -10/14, the \n",
      "Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance \n",

      "was not entitled to act in its place. The valid ity of the procedure followed by \n",
      "the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling \n",
      "character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the \n",
      "request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was  \n",
      "meeting in regular session, has also been questioned.  \n",
      "30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that .  \n",

      "The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency \n",
      "Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis \n",
      "as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, \n",
      "A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on \n",

      "Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers tha t the Security Council \n",
      "again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear \n",
      "to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 \n",
      "and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of \n",
      "the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of \n",
      "the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the \n",
      "negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth \n",
      "Emergency Special S ession was duly reconvened and could properly be \n",
      "seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.  \n",
      "32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency \n",
      "Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling \n",
      "within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and \n",
      "otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's \n",
      "opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the \n",
      "Security Council to request such an opinion.  \n",
      "33. Turning now to alleged f'urther procedural irregularities of the Tenth \n",
      "Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" \n",
      "character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April \n",
      "1997 and reconvened I I times s ince then, has any relevance with regard to the \n",
      "validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that \n",
      "regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, \n",
      "having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently r econvened four \n",
      "times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June  \n",
      "1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of \n",
      "resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances \n",
      "was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted \n",
      "during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.  \n",
      "34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to \n",
      "reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular \n",
      "session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, \n",
      "while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be \n",
      "appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and \n",
      "regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would \n",
      "be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the pre sent \n",
      "request for an advisory opinion.  \n",
      "35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been \n",
      "convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the \n",
      "General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in \n",
      "pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion \n",

      "declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to \n",
      "have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).  \n",
      "In view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that \n",
      "presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.  \n",
      "36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the \n",
      "present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory \n",
      "opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the \n",
      "meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, \n",
      "of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a \n",
      "question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two \n",
      "provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be \n",
      "amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the \n",
      "present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to \n",
      "determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked \n",
      "of the Court fo r two reasons.  \n",
      "First, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal \n",
      "consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible \n",
      "interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is  \n",
      "20 \n",
      "precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a \n",
      "request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then \n",
      "to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it \n",
      "has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked \n",
      "for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather \n",
      "to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General \n",
      "Assembly had wished to o btain the view of the Court on the highly complex \n",
      "and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should \n",
      "have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and \n",
      "Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. \n",
      "17). A second posSible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court \n",
      "should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its \n",
      "opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been \n",
      "contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this \n",
      "hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption \n",
      "and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal \n",
      "consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.  \n",
      " CONSTRUCTION OF A WALL (ADVISORY OPINION)  154 \n",
      "Secondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not \n",
      "of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In \n",
      "particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify \n",
      "whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the \n",
      "General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member \n",
      "States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the \n",

      "Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred \n",
      "to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal \n",
      "consequences arising from a giv en factual situation considering the rules and \n",
      "principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to \n",
      "the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 \n",
      "(hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Securi ty Council \n",
      "and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General \n",
      "Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on \n",
      "Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raiscasl problems of \n",
      "international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; \n",
      "indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. \n",
      "In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see \n",
      "Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Repor ts 1975, p. 18, para. 15).  \n",
      "38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the draf'ting of a \n",
      "question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncer - \n",
      "21 \n",
      "tainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary \n",
      "clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  \n",
      "In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed \n",
      "in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not \n",
      "accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being \n",
      "sought (Interpretation Q/• the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December \n",

      "particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information \n",
      "and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has conclud ed \n",

      "56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available \n",
      "to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular \n",
      "instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with \n",
      "Bulgaria, Hungary and Roman ia (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its \n",

      "the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on \n",

      "6(). As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the \n",
      "purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary \n",
      "for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the \n",

      "93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities \n",

      "Subsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions \n",
      "that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth \n",
      "Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to \n",
      "Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is \n",
      "not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, \n",
      "paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under \n",
      "the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party inv olved in an armed conflict. \n",
      "Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva \n",

      "Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by \n",
      "Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian \n",
      "sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure \n",
      "in those territories. According however to the great majority of other \n",

      "95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of \n",
      "the Fourth (Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two \n",
      "conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a \n",
      "state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two \n",
      "contracting parties. If those two conditions are satis42  \n",
      "fied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the \n",
      "course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  \n",
      "The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope \n",
      "of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by \n",
      "excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the \n",
      "contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if \n",
      "occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still \n",
      "applicable.  \n",
      "This interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of' the Fourth \n",
      "Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, \n",
      "in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague \n",
      "Regulations of 19()7 were as much c oncerned with protecting the rights of a \n",
      "State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that \n",
      "territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the \n",
      "protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied \n",
      "territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  \n",
      "That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires. \n",

      "when they inserted that p aragraph into the Convention, of restricting the \n",

      "Jordan were parties to that Conventio n when the 1967 armed conflict broke \n",

      "to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their \n",
      "national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from \n",

      "position that \"the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to \n",

      "The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the \n",
      "report, expressecl concern at Israel's attitude and pointed \"to the long -standing \n",

      "112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \n",
      "Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be \n",
      "explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are \n",
      "essentially territorial. However, it is not to be e xcluded that it applies \n",
      "both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those \n",
      "over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 \n",

      "para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  \n",
      "48 \n",

      "For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept \n",
      "Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have \n",
      "for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying \n",
      "Power. In the exerci se of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is \n",
      "bouncl by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social \n",
      "and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any \n",
      "obstacle to the exercise of such rights in tho se fields where competence has \n",
      "been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  \n",
      "1 13. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November \n",
      "1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which \"States Parties \n",
      "shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the . . . Convention to each \n",
      "child within their jurisd iction . That Convention is therefore applicable within \n",
      "the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  \n",
      "1 14. Having determined the rules and principles of international law \n",
      "relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having \n",
      "ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian \n",
      "Territory of international humanitari an law and human rights law, the Court \n",
      "will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violal:ed \n",
      "those rules and principles.  \n",

      "\"Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states \n",

      "contrary to international law \" and that \"The de facto annexation of land \n",
      " with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of \n",
      "the Palestinians to self -determination.\" This view was echoed in certain of \n",
      "the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views exp ressed at \n",
      "the hearings. Inler alia, it was contended that:  \n",
      "\n",

      "\"The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian \n",

      "constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisi(ion \n",
      "of territory by the use of force.'  \n",
      "In this connection, it was in particular emphasized that \"at]he route of the \n",

      "49 \n",

      "their right of self -determination' .  \n",
      "1 16. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable \n",
      "it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. \n",
      "Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary \n",
      "measure (see report of the Sec retary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia \n",
      "through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security \n",
      "Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that \"athe fence] does not \n",

      "tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a \n",
      "political settlement\" (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative \n",
      "restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December \n",
      "2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  \n",
      "\"As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The \n",

      "rule of \"the in'admissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\" (see \n",
      "paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November \n",
      "1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that:  \n",
      "\"the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just \n",

      "above).  \n",
      "1 1 8. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, \n",
      "the Court observes that the existence of a \"Palestinian people\" is no  \n",
      "50 \n",
      "longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the \n",
      "exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President \n",
      "of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli \n",
      "Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized \n",
      "\"the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security\" and made various \n",
      "other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in \n",
      "the light of those commitments, \"the Gover nment of Israel has decided to \n",

      "September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its \n",
      "\"legitimate rights\" (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, \n",
      "paras. I and 3; Article X X Il, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights \n",
      "include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover \n",
      "recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of \n",
      "22 December 20()3).  \n",
      "1 19. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli \n",
      "Government includes within the \"Closed Area\" (see paragraph 85 above) some \n",
      "80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. \n",
      "Moreover, it is apparent from an e xamination of the map mentioned in \n",
      "paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way \n",
      "as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the \n",
      "occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  \n",
      "120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph \n",
      "6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: \"The Occupying Power shall \n",
      "not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it \n",
      "occupies.\" That provisio n prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers \n",
      "of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also \n",
      "any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage \n",
      "transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  \n",
      "In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, \n",
      "Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the \n",
      "establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to \n",
      "the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n",
      "The Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices \n",
      "\"have no legal validity\". It has also called upon \"Israel, as the occupying \n",
      "Power, to abide scrupulously\" by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  \n",
      "\n",
      " CONSTRUCTION OF A WALL (ADVISORY OPINION)  184 \n",
      "\"to rescind its previous measures and to desist frorn taking any action \n",
      "which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature \n",
      "and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab \n",
      "territories occupied since 1967, including Jeru salem  \n",
      "51 \n",
      "and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into \n",
      "the occupied Arab territories\" (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  \n",
      "The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 \n",
      "and 465 (198()) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described \"Israel's \n",
      "policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in \n",
      "athe occupied] t erritories\" as a \"flagrant viola* tiorf' of the Fourth Geneva \n",
      "Convention.  \n",
      "The Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian \n",
      "Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of \n",
      "international law.  \n",
      "121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the \n",
      "construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of \n",
      "a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain \n",
      "indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will \n",
      "prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that \n",
      "Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court \n",
      "considers that the construction of the wall and its associated rég ime create a \n",
      "\"fait accompli\" on the ground that could well become permanent, in which \n",
      "case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it \n",
      "would be tantamount to de./hcto annexation.  \n",
      "122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the \n",
      "Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between \n",
      "the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West \n",
      "Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settle rs living in the Occupied Palestinian \n",
      "Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as \n",
      "237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, \n",
      "around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost comple tely encircled \n",
      "communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  \n",
      "In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the \n",
      "illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ \n",
      "as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There \n",
      "is also a risk of fur ther alterations to the demographic composition of the \n",
      "()ccupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall \n",
      "inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 \n",
      "below, to the departure of Palestinian populations Il -om certain areas. That \n",
      "construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the \n",

      "The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by \n",
      "the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, \n",
      "social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail \n",
      "to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 ol' the International Covenant on \n",
      "Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation \n",
      "must be \"solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a \n",

      "convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary \n",
      "to attain its security ohjectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its \n",
      "associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing \n",
      "in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that \n",
      "route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of \n",
      "national security or public order. The construclion of suc h a wall accordingly \n",
      "constitutes breaches by Israel of various  \n",
      "61 \n",
      "of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and \n",
      "human rights instruments.  \n",
      "138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall \n",
      "constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal \n",
      "obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the \n",
      "Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : \"the construction of the \n",

      "referred to, he continued, \"have clearly recognized the right of States to use \n",
      "force in self -defence against terrorist attacks\", and therefore surely recognize \n",
      "the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  \n",
      "139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  \n",
      "\"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of \n",
      "individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a \n",
      "Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken \n",
      "measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.\"  \n",
      "Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right \n",
      "of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. \n",
      "However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a \n",
      "foreign State.  \n",
      "The Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied \n",
      "Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards \n",
      "as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, \n",
      "that territory. The situa tion is thus dilTerent from that contemplated by \n",
      "Security Council resolutions 1368 (2()()1) and 1373 (2()()1), and therefore \n",
      "Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim \n",
      "to be exercising a right of self -defence.  \n",
      "Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 5 1 ol' the Charter has no \n",
      "relevance in this case.  \n",
      "140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a \n",
      "state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction \n",
      "of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the \n",
      "conventions at issue in the present insta nce include qualifying clauses of the \n",
      "rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  \n",
      "graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address \n",
      "considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked \n",
      "whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law \n",
      "could be invoked with regard to those treat ies as a ground for precluding \n",
      "the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, \n",
      "the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in \n",

      "   CONSTRUCTION OF A WALL (ADVISORY OPINION)  200 \\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the peaceful settlement \\nof disputes, would emphasize the urgent necessity for the United Nations as a \\nwhole to redouble its efforts to bring the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, which \\ncontinues to pose a thr eat to international peace and security, to a speedy \\nconclusion, thereby establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.  \\n162. The Court has reached the conclusion that the construction of the wall \\nby Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is contrary to international law \\nand has stated the legal consequences that are to be drawn from that illegality. \\nThe Court considers its elf bound to add that this construction must be placed \\nin a more general context. Since 1947, the year when General Assembly \\nresolution 1 81 (Il) was adopted and the Mandate for Palestine was terminated, \\nthere has been a succession of armed conllicts, acts  of indiscriminate violence \\nand repressive measures on the former mandated territory. The Court would \\nemphasize that both Israel and Palestine are under an obligation scrupulously \\nto observe the rules of international humanitarian law, one ol' the paramoun t \\npurposes of which is to protect civilian life. Illegal actions and unilateral \\ndecisions have been taken on all sides, whereas, in the Court's view, this tragic  \\n68 \\nsituation can be brought to an end only through implementation in good faith \\nof all relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 242 \\n(1967) and 338 (1973). The \"Roadmap\" approved by Security Council \\nresolution 1515 (2003) represents the  most recent of efforts to initiate \\nnegotiations to this end. The Court considers that it has a duty to draw the \\nattention of the General Assembly, to which the present Opinion is \\naddressed, to the need for these efforts to be encouraged with a view to \\nachieving as soon as possible, on the basis of international law, a negotiated \\nsolution to the outstanding problems and the establishment of a Palestinian \\nState, existing side by side with Israel and its other neighbours, with peace \\nand security for all in th e region.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \n",
