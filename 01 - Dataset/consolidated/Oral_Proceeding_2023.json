        "texto": "I will present Palestine’s arguments on jurisdiction and admissibility. I can, and will, be succinct, as there is no doubt that the Court has jurisdiction to give the requested opinion and that there are no compelling reasons for the Court to decline to issue the requested opinion. /n/nMr President, the Court clearly has jurisdiction to provide the requested opinion. The General Assembly is obviously competent to request the opinion in line with Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter. Moreover, resolution 77/247 was adopted by a clear majority and in full compliance with both the requirements of the Charter and the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure./n/nThe questions posed by the General Assembly are also plainly legal in character. As the Court has repeatedly and consistently confirmed in its jurisprudence, the fact that the questions may have political implications is irrelevant and does not bar the Court from fulfilling its essential judicial function. /n/nSecond, the function of this Court, of these judges, of you, is to state the law: to spell out the legal rights and obligations that will allow a just solution in the future, in conformity with international law. The political context is totally irrelevant. The legal questions in Namibia, in the Wall case, in the Chagos case, all had a political context, but the Court did not blink. It has never shied away from drawing the consequences of the right to self-determination. In Chagos and in Namibia, the Advisory Opinions have been significant and positive in their outcomes and effects. By identifying the applicable legal principles, and then applying them to the facts, the Court performs a most significant, uniquely significant role, for protagonists and for the international community as a whole. With great respect to my friends from the United States and Britain, it is the very opposite of what they have written: the function of this Court, in interpreting and applying the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, can only assist in a solution based on the law, by setting out the parameters required by the law to resolve the matter. A forthright advisory opinion from this Court makes a resolution more likely, not less likely."

        "texto": "Second, the questions concern the United Nations’ continuous responsibility for resolving the question of Palestine. This responsibility stems from its duties relating to matters of international peace and security arising under the Charter, and as the Court put it, “has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine”. This responsibility continues, as confirmed by the unequivocal and contemporary practice of the General Assembly, the Security Council, as well as other United Nations organs and bodies. /n/nSome of these submissions oppose the advisory opinion because of the purported existence of a “negotiation framework” or of bilateral “negotiations”. However, none of these considerations constitutes a reasonable basis for the Court to refuse the General Assembly’s request. To the contrary, an opinion from the Court will assist in these negotiations by confirming the applicable international legal framework, as affirmed in United Nations resolutions, in order to reach a just and peaceful solution. /n/nThe Court’s opinion can thus only contribute to achieving the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine called for by the Security Council. It  your opinion  will clarify the legal rights and obligations of Israel, of Palestine, of third States and of the United Nations to be reflected in a settlement that is truly consistent with international law. Thus, the Court’s opinion will also contribute to upholding the international rule of law at large. /n/nThird, the General Assembly, when deciding upon the request for the current advisory opinion, was acutely aware of the claim that such request would somehow purportedly undermine the chances of future negotiations. Nevertheless, the General Assembly decided to ask for the Court’s legal determination anyway. The General Assembly thus found that this argument had no merit. To the contrary, the General Assembly considered that the Court’s opinion would be helpful as to future steps to be taken by the political organs of the United Nations, as well as by all States. In line with your role as one of the principal organs of the organization, as envisaged in Article 7 of the Charter, the Court ought not now set aside this considered decision of the General Assembly. /n/nRather, Palestine invites the Court to fulfil its duty of providing its legal determination to the General Assembly by answering the legal questions put to it. In so doing, you will assist all States, as well as the United Nations, in furthering respect for the international rule of law, the fulfilment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, and a just and peaceful solution in accordance with international law. /n/nFor all the above reasons, the State of Palestine requests the Court to declare that Israel’s discriminatory practices against the Palestinian people are tantamount to apartheid, which this Court defined in its 1971 Advisory Opinion on Namibia as “distinctions, exclusions, restrictions and limitations exclusively based on grounds of race, colour or descent or national or ethnic origin, which constitute a denial of fundamental human rights”. This actually reflects the Palestinian reality."

        "texto": "I stand before you as 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, half of them children, are besieged and bombed, killed and maimed, starved and displaced. As more than 3.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are subjected to the colonization of their territory and the racist violence that enables it. As 1.7 million Palestinians in Israel are treated as second-class citizens, as unwelcomed intruders in their ancestral land. As 7 million Palestine refugees continue to be denied their right to return to their land and homes. I stand before you as the entire Palestinian people continue to be denied their fundamental rights, their very existence negated. /n/nThe United Nations enshrined in its Charter the right of all peoples to self-determination and pledged to rid the world of the gravest breaches of this right, namely colonialism and apartheid. Yet, for decades, the Palestinian people have been denied this right and have endured both colonialism and apartheid. There are those who are outraged by the use of these words. They should instead be outraged by the reality we are living. This reality is known by every Palestinian, suffered by millions, generation after generation./n/nIt is a reality where Israel can destroy Gaza, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians, almost half of them children, leaving 1 million children starved, terrorized and traumatized for life, orphaned of a mother, a father, or both, amputated and disabled, leaving nearly 2 million people displaced and desperate, with nowhere to shelter from the onslaught. The genocide underway in Gaza is the result of decades of impunity and inaction. Ending Israel’s impunity is a moral, political and legal imperative. /n/nI thus implore you, as you hear the legal arguments, not to forget the Palestinian people. Not to forget that our people are struggling every day for their survival as individuals, families, communities, as a nation. That less than a month ago, this Court ordered provisional measures in a landmark case brought by the Republic of South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention  an Order that Israel continues to defy with impunity. /n/nFor decades Israel has occupied the Palestinian territory, committing violations that are inherent to its presence in our land and colonial objective. This occupation is annexationist and supremacist in nature. It is a deliberate, cynical perversion of international law. It is thus illegal. The only solution consistent with international law is for this illegal occupation to come to an immediate, unconditional, and total end. /n/nIn 1967, Israel then occupied the remainder of Palestine. And from the first day of its occupation, started colonizing and annexing the land with the aim of making its occupation irreversible. It left us with a collection of disconnected Bantustans preventing the independence of our State, as shown in map 4. Israel wanted the geography of Palestine, but not its demography. So it kept pushing our people out: out of their homes, out of their land. /n/nHere is the fifth map. It was displayed by Israel’s Prime Minister to the General Assembly last September. He called this “the New Middle East”. There is no Palestine at all on this map, only Israel, comprised of all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. This shows you what the prolonged, continuous Israeli occupation of Palestine is intended to accomplish: the complete disappearance of Palestine and the destruction of the Palestinian people. /n/nIt has taken the Palestinian people decades of painful struggle to stand before you today. We appeal to the Court to uphold our rights to self-determination, return and all other human rights, including by declaring that the Israeli occupation is illegal and must end immediately, totally and unconditionally. /n/nFirst, the questions concern serious breaches of jus cogens and erga omnes norms. As my colleagues will show, those breaches, by Israel, include violations of:  the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force,  the prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid,  the denial of the right of self-determination,  as well as other egregious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law of the same character. /n/nFirst, Israel has repeatedly refused, to this very day, to engage in meaningful negotiations with Palestine on the basis of international law and United Nations resolutions. This is reflected in repeated statements, including, most recently, by the Israeli Prime Minister and other high-ranking Israeli officials. The mere hypothetical possibility of future negotiations cannot thus be used as a mere pretext for avoiding the application of international law to this crucial matter, or for avoiding responsibility for ongoing breaches of peremptory norms of international law. /n/nI will address the legality of Israel’s prolonged occupation, annexation and settlement of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In so doing, I will identify the elements that determine whether, and in what circumstances, a belligerent occupation is, or becomes, unlawful under international law; I will then review the evidence to assess whether those elements are present here; and I will show that, based on the applicable law and the well-established and undisputed facts, Israel’s 56-year occupation of Palestinian territory is manifestly and gravely unlawful, and that international law requires that it be brought to an end, completely and unconditionally. /n/nThe applicable rule of law is straightforward. As Pictet wrote in 1958, “occupation . . . is essentially a temporary . . . situation”. This remains the law. In December 2022, the General Assembly, in resolution 77/126, recognized that “the occupation of a territory is to be a temporary, de facto situation, whereby the occupying Power can neither claim possession nor exert its sovereignty over the territory it occupies”. This rule is neatly explained in the Written Statement of Switzerland: “The laws of occupation are built on the idea that occupation is only a temporary situation. They are based on four fundamental principles: 1) the occupying power does not acquire sovereignty over the territory it occupies; 2) the occupying power must maintain the status quo ante and must not take any measures which might bring about permanent changes”. The law is thus crystal clear: occupation can only be a temporary state of affairs. A permanent occupation is a legal oxymoron. /n/nMr President, what makes Israel’s ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territory unlawful is precisely its permanent character, and what demonstrates its permanence are: (i) Israel’s de jure and de facto annexation of Jerusalem and the West Bank; (ii) its claims of sovereignty over these areas, which it refers to by their biblical names, Judea and Samaria, and considers integral parts of the State of Israel; (iii) its establishment of hundreds of permanent Israeli settlements, with over 700,000 Israeli settlers, who have been promised by successive Israeli governments that they will never be removed; and (iv) the multitude of official statements and documents that openly declare Israel’s intention to incorporate all of the occupied territory east of the Green Line into the State of Israel as a permanent part of a single Jewish State extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. /n/nAs I will show you, the evidence is overwhelming and leaves no room for serious dispute about Israel’s actions or its intentions. As Israel’s Cabinet Secretary wrote in June of last year: “Judea and Samaria were not seized from a sovereign state recognized by international law, and the State of Israel has a right to impose its sovereignty over these areas as they comprise the cradle of history of the Jewish people and are an inseparable part of the Land of Israel.” As purported legal authority, the Cabinet Secretary invoked the First Book of Maccabees, written in the year 100 BC, chapter 15, verse 33: “It is not a foreign land we have taken nor have we seized the property of foreigners, but only our ancestral heritage, which for a time had been unjustly occupied by our enemies.” /n/nThis was followed in August of last year by a message broadcast on Israel’s Army Radio by Israel’s Heritage Minister: “Sovereignty must be extended within the borders of the West Bank . . . and in the most prudent way, to create international recognition that this place is ours . . . There is no Green Line, it is a fictitious line that creates a distorted reality and must be erased.” /n/nIn September 2023, Israel’s Prime Minister literally erased the Green Line, in his presentation to the United Nations General Assembly. As you saw earlier, he depicted the State of Israel as extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, eliminating not only the Green Line but all traces of Palestine. This was no oversight; it was an act of the Head of Government, with all the attribution that it implies. The same message was delivered by Israel’s Finance Minister in Paris, six months earlier, when he denied the existence of Palestine and declared that Palestinians do not constitute a people. Previously, he said: “We are here to stay. We will make it clear that our national ambition for a Jewish State from the river to the sea is an accomplished fact, a fact not open to discussion or negotiation.” This has been Israel’s consistent position. Here is the map of Israel produced by its armed forces and published by the Government in 2021. One State, Israel, from the river to the sea. There is no Green Line; there is no Palestine. Instead, Palestine has been replaced by “Judea” and “Samaria”, which, according to Israel’s highest officials, are now integral parts of the State of Israel. /n/nAs these official statements and maps demonstrate, Israel makes no secret of its intention to retain permanently the entire area east of the Green Line. Its annexation of occupied Palestinian territory began in 1967 with legislation annexing East Jerusalem, which Israel increased eleven-fold in size to incorporate not only the Holy City but also vast areas of the West Bank surrounding the City. Its Defence Minister, Moshe Dayan, declared at the time: “The Israel Defence Forces have liberated Jerusalem . . . We have returned to this most sacred shrine, never to part from it again.” In 1990, the Israeli Cabinet instructed the Foreign Minister to notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations that “Jerusalem is not, in any part, ‘occupied territory’; it is the sovereign capital of Israel”. In June 1996, the Guidelines of the incoming Israeli Government stated: “Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, is one city, whole and undivided, and will remain forever under Israel’s sovereignty.” More recently, in assuming office in December 2022, the current Prime Minister declared that “[t]he Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land nor occupiers in our eternal capital Jerusalem”. As these official statements make clear, Israel’s dominion over Jerusalem and the incorporated area of the West Bank is not intended to be temporary. It has been repeatedly proclaimed by Israel’s highest authorities to be “eternal”. /n/nIn furtherance of this end, more than 230,000 Israeli Jewish settlers  encouraged, subsidized and protected by the Israeli Government and occupation forces  have been installed in East Jerusalem, dramatically altering the demographic composition of the Holy City by creating an Israeli Jewish majority. /n/nIsrael has been equally clear in declaring its permanence in the West Bank, where more than 465,000 Israeli Jewish settlers have been implanted with the support of every Israeli government since 1967, in over 270 ever-expanding settlements, spread throughout this territory, in what can only be described as a vast colonial enterprise. These settlements, whose accelerated growth and distribution over the years are illustrated on your screens now, are a key instrument of Israel’s annexation of the West Bank; this is both their purpose and their effect. /n/nAs the Secretary-General reported to the General Assembly in 2015: “Occupation is supposed to be temporary because the annexation or acquisition of territory by force is strictly prohibited under international law . . . In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the establishment and maintenance of the settlements amount to a slow, but steady annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory.” /n/nIsrael has made no secret of the intended permanence of these settlements. In 2010, Prime Minister Netanyahu told Israeli settlers in the West Bank: “Our message is clear. ‘We are planting here, we will stay here, we will build here. This place will be an inseparable part of the State of Israel for eternity.’” In August 2019, the Prime Minister announced that: “The time has come to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and to also arrange the status of all Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria . . . They will be part of the State of Israel.” In January 2020, Israel’s Defence Minister, Naftali Bennett, declared: “Our objective is that within a short amount of time . . . we will apply sovereignty to all of Area C, not just the settlements, not just this bloc or another.” /n/nIn December 2022, the Guiding Principles of the incoming Israeli Government declared: “The Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all parts of the Land of Israel. The Government will promote and develop the settlement of all parts of the Land of Israel  the Galilee, the Negev, the Golan and Judea and Samaria.” The coalition agreement between the political parties that formed the Government included this pledge: “[T]he Prime Minister will lead the formulation and promotion of policy in which sovereignty will be applied in Judea and Samaria, while choosing the timing and weighing all the national and international interests of the State of Israel.” /n/nGeneral Assembly resolution 77/126 was adopted on 12 December 2022, just as the current Israeli Government was assuming office. The resolution pointedly recalled: “[T]he principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force and therefore the illegality of the annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, which constitutes a breach of international law” and the resolution condemned Israel’s “annexation of land, whether de facto or through national legislation”. /n/nIsrael has thoroughly disregarded resolution 77/126, just as it disregarded all prior General Assembly and Security Council resolutions declaring illegal the annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the establishment of Israeli settlements there. These include but are by no means limited to:  Security Council resolution 252 of 1968, declaring Israel’s acquisition of territory by military conquest “inadmissible”;  resolution 476 of 1980, which “[r]eaffirm[ed] the overriding necessity for ending the prolonged occupation of Arab territories” in 1980 and “[s]trongly deplore[d] the refusal of Israel . . . to comply with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly”;  resolution 478 of 1980, which “determine[d] that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel . . . to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and in particular the ‘basic law’ on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith”;  resolution 2334 of 2016, which “reaffirm[ed] . . . the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force”, and condemned “all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 . . . including, inter alia, the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians”; and  at least 28 General Assembly resolutions, which expressly condemned Israel’s “annexation” of Jerusalem and the West Bank. /n/nIsrael has also blatantly disregarded the obligations reflected in the Court’s 2004 Advisory Opinion in the Wall case. Since then, instead of dismantling the wall, Israel has extended it from a length of 190 km to more than 460 km, encompassing hundreds of additional square kilometres of Palestinian land, and incorporating it into the State of Israel. In its Advisory Opinion, the Court expressed concern lest “the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a ‘fait accompli’ on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation”. /n/nAnd that is precisely what has happened over the past 20 years, not only within the expanded confines of the wall, but all across the West Bank, most of which has now been annexed de facto by Israel. In 2022, the report of the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry concluded: “Israel treats the occupation as a permanent fixture and has  for all intents and purposes  annexed parts of the West Bank . . . The International Court of Justice anticipated such a scenario in its 2004 advisory opinion . . . This has now become the reality.” /n/nThe Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory reached the same conclusion: “The occupation by Israel has been conducted in profound defiance of international law . . . Its 55-year-old occupation burst through the restraints of temporariness long ago. Israel has progressively engaged in the de jure and de facto annexation of occupied territory.” /n/nMr President, Israel’s ongoing annexation of the West Bank accelerated in 2023, with the largest ever expansion of settlements in the territory. Twenty-two new settlements were authorized and more than 16,000 new housing units were built, funded or planned by Israeli authorities. As explained by Israel’s Finance Minister: “The construction boom in Judea and Samaria and all over our country continues . . . We will continue to develop the settlement[s] and strengthen the Israeli hold on the territory.” /n/nIn developing its settlements, Israel has invested heavily in the infrastructure needed to supply them with water and electric power, as well as a network of roads and highways to connect them to one another and to Israel itself. These investments, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, attest to the intended permanent character of the settlements. The roads, which Palestinians are forbidden to use, and a pervasive system of roadblocks and checkpoints, prevent Palestinians but not Israeli settlers from moving from place to place in the West Bank, and they isolate Palestinian communities by cutting them off from one another. Israel’s settlement expansion has thus both uprooted Palestinians from their homes to make room for new settlements, and forced them to live in disconnected and non-contiguous enclaves, which the Special Rapporteur has called “a fragmented archipelago of 165 disparate patches of land”. This achieves the fundamental objective of the occupation: permanent acquisition of the maximum amount of Palestinian territory, with the minimum number of Palestinians in it. /n/nIn furtherance of this objective, and with increasing frequency, armed groups of settlers, supported by Israel’s occupation forces and encouraged by government ministers, have violently expelled thousands of peaceful Palestinian civilians from their ancestral villages and lands. A United Nations Fact Finding Mission confirmed: “[T]he motivation behind this violence and the intimidation against the Palestinians and their properties is to drive the local populations away from their lands and allow the settlements to expand.” The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported in March 2023: “[S]ettler violence further intensified, reaching the highest levels ever recorded by the United Nations.” In November 2023, the High Commissioner warned that the situation had further deteriorated with “a sharp increase in settler violence and takeover of land across the West Bank. Since 7 October,” he continued, “nearly 1,000 Palestinians from at least 15 herding communities have been forced from their homes”. /n/nThe Secretary-General, in his most recent report, issued on 25 October 2023, expressly linked the expansion of Israeli settlements to the permanent acquisition of Palestinian territory: “[S]uccessive Israeli Governments have consistently advanced and implemented policies of settlement expansion and takeover of Palestinian land. The policies of the current Government in this regard are aligned, to an unprecedented extent, with the goals of the Israeli settler movement to expand long-term control over the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and, in practice, to further integrate those areas within the territory of the State of Israel.” /n/nApparently, very far indeed. According to former US President Barack Obama, in the memoir he published in 2020: “[J]ust about every country in the world considered Israel’s continued occupation of the Palestinian territories to be a violation of international law. As a result, our diplomats found themselves in the awkward position of having to defend Israel for actions that we ourselves opposed.”70 This is exactly what the United States is doing  again  in these proceedings. /n/nStarting from the Nakba of 1948 until now, Israel has adopted discriminatory legislation and measures by which it has established a deeply entrenched system of racial discrimination against Palestinians, subjugating them to Israeli domination and denying their fundamental rights. /n/nDiscrimination against the Palestinian people is as integral to Israel’s prolonged occupation as is the annexation and colonization of the Palestinian territory. They are inextricable parts of the same whole and feed off each other. /n/nUsing “a toolbox of population control” and inhumane acts amounting to aggravated forms of racial discrimination, Israel restricts every aspect of Palestinian life, from birth to death, resulting in manifest human rights violations and an overt system of repression and persecution. /n/nThrough indiscriminate killing, summary execution, mass arbitrary arrest, torture, forced displacement, settler violence, movement restrictions and blockades, Israel subjects Palestinians to inhumane life conditions and untold human indignities, affecting the fate of every man, woman and child under its control. /n/nPalestinians, and Palestinians only, endure horrific levels of extensive human and material losses, including home demolitions enforced as collective punishment. All of this has created a coercive environment that facilitates Israel’s forcible displacement of Palestinians. /n/nAs described by the Special Rapporteur: “Collective punishment is an inflamed scar that runs across the entire Israeli occupation of Palestine. Notwithstanding numerous resolutions, reports and reminders critical of its use, Israel continues to rely upon collective punishment as a prominent instrument in its coercive toolbox of population control. The logic of collective punishment has been to project domination in order to subdue a subjugated population through inflicting a steep price for its resistance to alien rule.” /n/nApartheid exists in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Twenty participant States expressly hold the same position including victims of apartheid, South Africa and Namibia. /n/nFinally, the inhuman acts are committed with the purpose of maintaining the apartheid régime, and by it, maintaining permanently Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. /n/nA one-State reality of unequal rights consolidating segregation and apartheid against Palestinians is reflected in the inherently discriminatory character of the 2018 Basic Law “Israel  The Nation-State of the Jewish People”. /n/nUnder this law, “exercising the right to national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people”. Developing Jewish settlements became an Israeli “national value”, not only in the occupied West Bank and the Syrian Golan but even in Israel, and I ask where? On which lands? The answer is on the lands where Palestinian citizens of Israel live, especially in the Galilee and the Naqab. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, in its written statement the State of Palestine explained that the right to self-determination comprises four specific components. First, the right to territorial integrity. Second, the right not to be subjected to demographic manipulation within that territory by a foreign power. Third, the right to exercise permanent sovereignty over its natural resources. And fourth, the right to be able to pursue its chosen economic, social and cultural development. The prolonged occupation, colonization and purported annexation by Israel of Palestinian territory, with all the discriminatory and other unlawful acts, have and continue to deprive the Palestinian people of each of these four distinct components. /n/nLet me start with the right to territorial integrity, so recently recognized and given effect by the Court in its Advisory Opinion on Chagos, and endorsed by an overwhelming majority by the General Assembly of the United Nations. This implements resolutions 1514 and 2625. Yet, Israel has clearly violated the territorial integrity of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, through over more than half a century of belligerent occupation. As Mr Reichler has described, it has purportedly annexed Jerusalem and the West Bank, and it has established hundreds of settlements populated by more than 700,000 settlers, regarded as a permanent part of Israel. It has extended the Wall that this Court found to be illegal in 2004. It has confined Palestinians to enclaves. It has severed Jerusalem, it has restricted Palestinian rights of entry from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It has transformed the Gaza Strip into an impoverished enclave, a besieged, bombarded community, severed from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Its leaders have declared that Israel will be sovereign over all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea and it has made this formal government policy. /n/nWhat is the consequence of this? It is the acquisition of territory by force. It is the reduction and fragmentation, as you have seen, of the territory left for the Palestinians. This is a manifest violation of Palestine’s territorial integrity, its unity, its contiguity, which are core elements of the right to self-determination. The General Assembly, the Security Council, the Human Rights Council have repeatedly called for the preservation of Palestine’s territorial integrity, and condemned Israel’s acts as a violation of the right of the Palestinian people to exercise their self-determination. We urge the Court to declare Israel’s 56-year occupation to be unlawful, to confirm, to take the words of your recent opinion in the Chagos case, that Israel is under an obligation to bring its presence on the territory of Palestine to an end and to do so as rapidly as possible. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the fourth component of the right to self-determination is the right of a people to determine its own political status and direction, and to pursue its own economic, social and cultural development of its choice. This is confirmed by a multitude of instruments and General Assembly resolutions. Yet Israel persists in prohibiting and punishing political expressions of Palestinian identity and nationhood. Flags are outlawed and attacked. Civil society organizations and political parties are declared to be unlawful. Leaders and elected representatives, and civilians more generally, including so many children, are assaulted, exiled, imprisoned or killed. /n/nGeneral Assembly resolutions and many treaties confirm that these rights exist under international law. And they have been systematically violated. The economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people are suppressed by a prolonged and unlawful occupation; by the purported annexation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem; by the settlements; by the wall and its associated régime and infrastructure; by the blockade of Gaza; by the fragmentation of land; by the deprivation of resources; by the restrictions on freedom and movement of people and of goods; and by a multitude of other acts of subjugation and collective punishment. These acts, and others, have curtailed the access of the Palestinian people to livelihoods; they have made the country and the people totally dependent on aid. /n/nIn summary, Israel has arrogated to itself the right to decide who owns Palestinian land, who may live on it, and how it is to be used. On Israel’s approach, it decides on the use of resources and allocation of benefits. On Israel’s approach, it decides whether Palestinians remain or return. On Israel’s approach, it decides how, if at all, Palestinians may meet, trade, teach, worship, live, love. /n/nMr President, let us be blunt: Israel has sought to negate the rights of the Palestinian people to exercise their right of self-determination, in all aspects, across all parts of the territory of Mandatory Palestine. It has done so for decades and it wishes to do so forever. Tragically, tragically, Israel celebrates the manifest violation of international law inherent in its prolonged occupation. Tragically, tragically, Israel asserts “the right of national self-determination in the state of Israel is unique to the Jewish people”, under its own 2018 Basic Law. Tragically, tragically, Israel sets its face against the role of international law. No one in this Great Hall of Justice is starry-eyed about international law, but it is what we have, and it is your role, as judges of this Court, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, to affirm the place and the power of international law, to confirm the illegality of the occupation, to make clear that Palestine — in all respects — meets the criteria of statehood under international law with all the rights and responsibilities that implies. /n/nAs we address you today, this breach has reached its most inhumane levels. More than two million Palestinians in Gaza are being pushed all the way to the border, to the very brink, Palestinian children, women and men consumed by disease, despair, destruction and death, which are spreading like wildfire. /n/nInstead, Israel started to colonize the land. /n/nInstead, Israel denied the existence of the Palestinian people."

He later declared: “I will not compromise on full security control over all the territory west of Jordan  and this is contrary to a Palestinian state.”72 Israel’s intransigence was confirmed by its staunchest ally in December 2023, when US President Joe Biden publicly lamented that Israel’s leaders “don’t want anything remotely approaching a two-state solution”73. /n/nThat is the very solution demanded by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the overwhelming majority of States and the State of Palestine itself. It is, in fact, the only solution that can lead to lasting peace and security for the Israeli people as well as the Palestinian people. And it is this very solution that has been frustrated by Israel’s defiant insistence on maintaining its dominion over Palestinian territory in perpetuity. This is why the Court’s advisory opinion is so critical and so urgent. The best, and possibly the last, hope for the two-State solution that is so vital to the needs of both peoples is for the Court to declare illegal the main obstacle to that solution  the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine  and for it to pronounce, in the clearest possible terms, that international law requires that this entire illegal enterprise be terminated: completely, unconditionally and immediately. /n/nMr President, the law is clear and it demands nothing less. A permanent occupation  one that is founded upon annexation and massive settlement of the occupied territory, and which aims to exercise sovereignty over it  is manifestly and gravely unlawful; it is an ongoing international wrong that must be brought to an immediate end. As the Court ruled in 1971: “[T]he continued presence of South Africa in Namibia being illegal, South Africa is under obligation to withdraw its administration from Namibia immediately and thus put an end to its occupation of the Territory”. /n/nThe Secretary-General applied this principle directly to Palestine in his remarks to the Security Council one month ago: “Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully independent, viable and sovereign State realized, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements. Israel’s occupation must end.” /n/nMr President, the proverbial ball is now in your court. The General Assembly has asked you the critical questions. It is now your responsibility to answer them. Silence is not an option. As the immortal Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, wrote: “In silence we become accomplices.” But, he assured us, when we speak: “Every word has the power to change the world.” /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, your words have such power. In 2004, the Court affirmed the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. In 2024, it is time for you to enable them finally to exercise that right, by freeing them from the unlawful Israeli occupation of their territory, so that they may live in a sovereign and fully independent State of their own, in peaceful and secure coexistence with all their neighbours, including Israel. By upholding international law, which is all the State of Palestine asks you to do, your powerful words will change the world. /n/nIsrael’s measures, policies and practices against the Palestinian people are no less pervasive in their reach or less pernicious in their consequences than the institutionalized racial discrimination and segregation that existed in South Africa. And just like in 1971, the international community relies on this Court to play its own genuine role to bring about an end to this glaring injustice. An immediate end to this illegal situation will bestow on the Palestinian people the fundamental rights to which they are entitled by international law, yet unfortunately they have been so unjustly denied. /n/nWhat are the consequences of Israel’s violations of Palestine’s right to self-determination and its exercise? Professor Pellet is going to address these matters, so I can be brief: as the purpose and effect of the occupation is the denial of the right of self-determination, and the prevention — let’s be frank — of the solution called for by the Security Council, the General Assembly and the vast majority of States of our world, premised on the existence of the two-State solution — the occupation is illegal and must be brought to an “immediate, unconditional and total” end. The right of self-determination requires that UN Member States bring Israel’s occupation to an immediate end. No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No contribution to forcible actions. No money, no arms, no trade, no nothing. All UN Members are obliged by law to end Israel’s presence on the territory of Palestine. /n/nFor 75 years, the Palestinian people have faced attempts to push them out of geography and, indeed, out of history. And it goes on. And it will go on forever, unless and until international law is upheld. Unless and until the unlawful occupation of Palestine ends. /n/nWe call on you to confirm that Israel’s presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal, that the presence of its occupation forces and settlers is illegal, and that its occupation must thus come to an immediate, complete and unconditional end. This occupation has served as cover for Israel’s colonial designs: the acquisition of Palestinian territory by force. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, based on the United Nations record, you should have no difficulty arriving at the conclusion that the occupation is prolonged, that Palestinian territory has been annexed, that our self-determination has been denied, and that the people of Palestine have been subjected to systematic racial discrimination."

        "texto": "The occupation alone has persisted for 56 years. As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, explained in 2022, “[t]he occupation by Israel has been conducted in profound defiance of international law and hundreds of United Nations resolutions, with scant pushback from the international community.” /n/nIn the Construction of a Wall case, this Court held that: “The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law . . . [and that Israel is under an obligation to] dismantle forthwith the structure therein situated, and to repeal or render ineffective forthwith all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto”. /n/nPalestinians continue to be subjected to routine violent Israeli raids on their homes  with thousands of adults and children being subjected to unlawful arbitrary arrests by Israeli soldiers, in the dead of night, and indefinitely renewable internment without trial  known euphemistically as “administrative detention”; and a dual legal system pursuant to which Palestinians  including Palestinian children  are tried under military legislation by military judges  often themselves illegal settlers, in Israeli military courts, without basic protection of international humanitarian and human rights law, while Israeli settlers living illegally in the same territory are subject to an entirely different legal régime, and tried in Israeli civilian courts with full access to due process. /n/nIsrael has occupied the Palestinian territory in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and annexed East Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank in that same year. It is not disputed that the acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force is illegal, irrespective of whether the territory was acquired through a war of self-defence or of an act of aggression. The occupying Power cannot annex any part of the occupied territory and there is an obligation on States not to recognize such an illegal territorial acquisition. /n/nHowever, it is clear that Israel has turned the temporary nature of the occupation into a permanent situation, in violation of the Palestinian right to self-determination. It has done this through its illegal settlement enterprise, which now consists of an estimated 700,000 settlers  an increase of 235 per cent since the Oslo Peace Accords, and of 165 per cent since the Wall Opinion. /n/nIn that case, the Court found that Israel has taken measures that “severely impeded the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination”, in breach of that fundamental right. The very disruption of Palestinian territorial integrity resulting from those settlements as well as Israel’s formal and de facto annexation of parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, constitute further violations of that fundamental right. /n/nIn terms of international humanitarian law, the continuing construction and expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are in clear violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party and which the Court has found in the Wall case to be binding upon Israel. /n/nThe extent of human rights violations and discriminatory laws and practices by Israel with respect to the Palestinian population is well documented in various reports of the treaty-based and charter-based mechanisms of the United Nations and is recalled in resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. These policies and practices have reached the threshold of apartheid within the meaning ascribed to it in the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid."

First, because the opinion might prejudice a negotiation process aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which those States consider to be ongoing26. And second, because the questions posed concern a bilateral dispute between Israel and Palestine. Not only are those arguments misguided, but they have been repeatedly rejected by this esteemed Court under highly analogous circumstances, including in the Wall Advisory Opinion27. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the second argument raised by certain States is that the Court should refrain from rendering the requested opinion because it relates to a strictly bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine47. This argument has been rejected by the Court in several prior contexts, including in the Wall Advisory Opinion48, and should, we believe, be disposed of by the Court in the same manner in this case. /n/nNot only is the argument legally unfounded49, but the fact that the questions posed to the Court are of a multilateral nature is self-evident.

        "texto": "Israel defends this obscene brutality as the necessary price for defeating Hamas. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia firmly rejects this twisted logic. Israel’s actions in laying waste to the Gaza Strip, killing and maiming tens of thousands of innocent civilians, depriving them of food, water and the basic means of survival while displacing virtually the entire population of 2.3 million people are not justified under any circumstances. Israel’s actions have severely dehumanized the Palestinian population, treating them as dispensable objects rather than human beings. These disgraceful acts, which have brought about formal accusation before this esteemed Court that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian population, as well as an Order on provisional measures recognizing the plausibility of those accusations and ordering Israel to comply with its obligations under the Genocide Convention23, necessarily weigh heavily upon the consideration of the questions before the Court in this proceeding. For if nothing else, they demonstrate all too vividly how the illegality of the Israeli occupation over more than five decades can degenerate into the ugliest of consequences. /n/nThe only logical conclusion that can be drawn from all of this is that Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are legally indefensible. /n/nIn the 2004 Wall proceedings, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia described Israel’s modus operandi in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 1967 as “deliberately enhance[ing] its position and chang[ing] the territorial status quo to its benefit”29. The Court rightly recognized this reality in its Advisory Opinion, referring to the illegality of Israel’s settlement practice in the Occupied Palestinian Territory30. The Court also warned “the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a ‘fait accompli’ on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case . . . it would be tantamount to de facto annexation”31. This assessment was prescient, and tragically — but predictably — resulted in no change in Israel’s illegal conduct. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than in the number of illegal settlers residing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which has grown from roughly 424,000 in 200432 to some 700,000 settlers today33. /n/nSince 1967, far from engaging in negotiations, Israel has made it virtually impossible to establish a cohesive Palestinian State. It has done so by annexing more than 2 million dunams of land34, building more than 279 illegal settlements throughout the West Bank35, illegally annexing East Jerusalem and declaring Jerusalem as its undivided capital36, confiscating natural resources37, demolishing Palestinian homes38, and much more. Those actions are well documented in the many United Nations reports discussed in the Kingdom’s Written Statement and I will not dwell on them further, except to make the self-evident point that Israel’s actions have clearly aimed at frustrating a negotiated settlement rather than opening the door to such a settlement39. /n/nWe submit that the catastrophic consequences of Israel’s policies and practices on the ground, as well as their sheer illegality, are undeniable. The international community has seen stark evidence of these consequences during the current war in Gaza. The ongoing situation is so appalling that last December the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza54, while the Court has recognized the plausibility that Israel’s conduct amounts to genocide and ordered it to comply with a series of provisional measures55. /n/nMoreover, Israel has continued implementing its infamous settlement practice in the Occupied Palestinian Territory despite the repeated condemnation of this practice by the Security Council and this Court’s determination of their illegality in the Wall Advisory Opinion58. Yet Israel makes no secret of its intention to maintain and expand settlements, as well as its possession of all or part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by the use of force. /n/nIsrael’s 2018 Basic Law also shows Israel’s disdain for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination by declaring the Holy City of Jerusalem “complete and united” as Israel’s capital. Stipulating that “[t]he exercise of the right to national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish People” is also incompatible with the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem59. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes to emphasize that international law obligations, particularly those embodied in the peremptory norms of general international law, are not abstract rules, and are not intended to be. Their violations entail particular legal consequences, but also have real and tangible consequences. The latter include most prominently the denial to human beings of their right to life and dignity, and more widely the creation of threats to peace and stability, with unpredictable consequences. The multiple and grave violations by Israel of its international obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is therefore of undeniable concern not only to those directly affected, but also to the international community as a whole61. /n/nTo be clear, Israel’s occupation was, from its commencement in June 1967, an illegal use of force, and it continues to be so. The Kingdom noted this in its submission in the Wall Advisory Opinion62. The illegal nature of the 56-year occupation has only been aggravated by Israel’s numerous other international law violations, including of jus cogens norms. Given the illegality surrounding every aspect of Israel’s occupation, that occupation is simply indefensible as a matter of international law."

And while the brutal and genocidal onslaught of Gaza by the Israeli military since October 2023 has led it to become, in the words of the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, a “place of death and despair”46, it should not be forgotten that Israel’s aggression has been accompanied by unyielding statements by its leaders that it will never agree to a sovereign Palestinian State or cede control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Such statements hardly reflect Israel’s intention to engage in genuine peace negotiations. /n/nHowever, as we speak, Israel continues to defy the international community’s call for a ceasefire and to wilfully ignore the provisional measures ordered by the Court. More generally, Israel has over the decades of its occupation persisted in its egregious violations of its most fundamental international law obligations. As explained in our Written Statement, Israel is in continuous breach of several jus cogens norms, notwithstanding multiple Security Council and General Assembly resolutions condemning its conduct and this Court’s findings in the Wall Advisory Opinion56. /n/nThese violations include Israel taking continuous measures to prevent the Palestinian people from exercising their right of self-determination through various policies and practices, including, among others, the illegal settlement practice in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes and theft of Palestinian property, the denial of sovereignty over their natural resources, and the breach of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights57. /n/nBut Israel’s breaches of international law do not end there. There can be no serious debate that Israeli policies and practices also amount to racial discrimination and are tantamount to apartheid, in grave violation of the Palestinian people’s human rights. Israel’s seizure of land and resources for Israeli settlers and its discriminatory application of laws and regulations to the detriment of the Palestinian people are merely examples of this egregious conduct. Israel violates the human rights of the Palestinian people in multiple other ways and in breach of its conventional obligations, including the rights of women and children. /n/nI will now move on to the second question before the Court, regarding the manner in which Israel’s conduct affects the legal status of its occupation. The Kingdom respectfully submits that the only conclusion which may be reached from the multiple and grave breaches of international law emanating from its occupation is that Israel’s occupation itself is illegal and must be brought to an unconditional end. Any other conclusion would be anomalous and inconsistent with the clearly illegal origin and conduct of the occupation, including the violations of jus cogens norms, that Israel has and continues to engage in through its occupation."

        "texto": "As the Court knows quite well, the international system is based on certain fundamental principles of law, which include peremptory norms of international law, or jus cogens norms. Adherence to these norms is not subject to derogation and compliance with them is owed erga omnes — to the international community as a whole. Some of the recognized jus cogens norms include the prohibition of aggression, the prohibition of genocide, the prohibition of apartheid and the right to self-determination.\n\nIf a particular action of a State violates one or more jus cogens norms, that action is illegal under international law. Any State may invoke the responsibility of that State for such a violation and seek an immediate end to it.\n\nThis is, fundamentally, the situation regarding Israel’s occupation in the Palestinian territories. The international community, collectively over many years, has found Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories to be illegal, among other reasons, on account of its violation of multiple jus cogens norms. And collectively we have invoked Israel’s responsibility in that regard to end the occupation.\n\nMr President, at least one State in the course of these proceedings has suggested that an occupation under international law cannot be illegal under any circumstances. This argument posits that “an occupation exists, therefore it is legal”. The proposition is unfounded in international law and fails for several reasons.\n\nFirst, this argument confuses jus in bello, and completely ignores the jus ad bellum. As the Court is well aware, international humanitarian law, and the jus in bello, is the body of law that governs the ways in which warfare can be conducted. It includes within it the law of occupation, a body of rules regulating the conduct of an occupying Power. It is, indeed, true that the obligations under jus in bello as they relate to an occupation persist throughout the pendency of that occupation.\n\nBut separate from jus in bello is the jus ad bellum, or the conditions under which States may resort to armed force. It is the jus ad bellum that addresses the legality of a use of force, including an occupation, which is maintained by the ongoing use of force. Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter prohibits the threat or use of force in any “manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. The only exceptions to this prohibition are the very narrow circumstances of the force authorized by the United Nations Security Council or self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. Any use of force outside of these narrow exceptions — i.e. any annexation or occupation of territory arising from an act of aggression or otherwise unlawful use of force — is illegal. Any use of force that is unnecessary or disproportionate to the threat against which it is exercised is also illegal under jus ad bellum.\n\nSecond, the proposition that “an occupation exists, therefore it is legal” also ignores the existence and implications of jus cogens norms going beyond the jus ad bellum. If an occupation inherently violates one or more jus cogens norms, then it is illegal as a whole and the occupying Power’s responsibility for that violation can be invoked in order to bring the violation to an end. The occupying Power’s ongoing obligations under international humanitarian law do not, and cannot, preclude the wrongfulness of jus cogens violations inherent in the occupation itself.\n\nFor example, the argument that occupations are inherently legal, if adopted, would directly conflict with and undermine the prohibition on the annexation of territory. Any State that wanted to de facto annex a territory could do so by indefinitely occupying that territory but not formally incorporating it within its borders. It is the same with the jus cogens norms of the rights of self-determination. Simply put, flagrant violations of international law cannot be brushed aside by the fig leaf of occupation.\n\nFinally, the thesis that “an occupation exists, therefore it is legal” also ignores the fact that the Court has determined occupations to be unlawful in the past. As discussed in The Gambia’s Written Statement, this was the case regarding South Africa’s occupation of Namibia without title and regarding Uganda’s occupation of the Congolese province of Ituri. The United Nations Security Council and the General Assembly have characterized occupations resulting from unlawful uses of force to be illegal as well.\n\nIn sum, a belligerent occupation can be illegal per se if it violates the jus ad bellum and other jus cogens norms."

        "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, The Gambia will highlight three reasons why Israel’s prolonged occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal. All three of these reasons — the right of self-determination, the prohibition on apartheid and the jus ad bellum — reflect obligations rooted in jus cogens norms. This conclusion of illegality is shared by a substantial majority of the Participants in these proceedings, many for the same reasons as The Gambia.\n\nThe right to self-determination\n\nFirst, Israel’s occupation violates the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and is therefore illegal. The erga omnes right of self-determination is “one of the essential principles of contemporary international law”, a jus cogens norm enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court has before it extensive and uncontested fact-finding by multiple United Nations mandate holders, including the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the many reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. These reports have been produced by independent United Nations mandate holders who engaged in extensive fact-finding utilizing multiple sources of evidence. The Court should accept these reports as conclusive and convincing evidence of Israel’s long-standing, ongoing and indefinite infringement on the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people.\n\nIndeed, there is no end in sight to Israel’s occupation. Already extending over 56 years, Israel’s current leadership boasts with pride its long-standing efforts to prevent the creation of an independent Palestinian State. As reported by the United Nations Special Rapporteur, Israel’s “occupation violates Palestinians’ ability to organize themselves as a people, free from alien domination and control”.\n\nNo derogation is permitted from respecting the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. There is no escaping the conclusion that Israel’s occupation is illegal for violating the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and that it must expeditiously be brought to an end.\n\nThe prohibition on apartheid\n\nSecond, Israel’s ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories is also illegal because it amounts to a régime of apartheid, the prohibition of which is a peremptory norm of international law. This Court has described apartheid as a “flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter”.\n\nOnce again, the Court has before it extensive, credible and independent fact-finding demonstrating conclusively that Israel has imposed an apartheid reality in the Palestinian territories. This is clear in the reporting of the United Nations Special Rapporteur, who concluded that “Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world”. This is also reflected in the findings of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.\n\nSenior international leaders, like Ban Ki-moon, Desmond Tutu and former Israeli officials, including a former Attorney General, a former director of Israel’s Intelligence Service, Shin Bet, and a former Ambassador of Israel to South Africa, have also concluded that Israel’s occupation constitutes a régime of apartheid.\n\nThe most credible non-governmental human rights organizations that report on the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory have also concluded that the occupation is, in fact and in law, an apartheid régime.\n\nA sober review of the uncontroverted evidence convincingly shows that the occupation is a régime of apartheid. As such, Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must urgently be brought to an end.\n\nThe jus ad bellum\n\nThird, Israel’s 56-year occupation of Palestinian territories violates the laws on the use of force — jus ad bellum — and is illegal for that reason as well.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the prohibition on the threat and use of force is a jus cogens norm. Even when resort to force is justified by self-defence in response to an armed attack, the particular force used may still be illegal if it is unnecessary or disproportionate to the threat against which it is exercised.\n\nIsrael launched the June 1967 war that led to its occupation of the Palestinian Territory. After its surprise attack initiating the war, Israel occupied all remaining Palestinian territory in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, as well as Syria’s Golan Heights and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, “effectively tripling the size of territory under [its] control”. Since this use of force was not taken in response to an armed attack and was not necessary or proportionate even if it had been, the occupation was a flagrant violation of the laws of the use of force from the onset.\n\nFurthermore, even if the occupation of the Palestinian territories were lawful at one time, its continuation for more than five decades means that it could not possibly still be lawful today. First, the use of force in self-defence is only justified “within the strict confines” laid down in Article 51 of the Charter and “does not allow the use of force by a State to protect perceived security interests beyond [those] parameters”. As such, “essentially preventative” uses of force are beyond the scope of Article 51.\n\nSecond, as clarified in the Wall Advisory Opinion, Article 51 does not apply to situations involving conduct taken in response to purported threats emanating from within occupied territory. Israel therefore cannot justify its occupation as a response to illegal threats emanating from within the Occupied Palestinian Territory itself.\n\nIsrael’s ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories also violates the jus ad bellum because its maintenance is unnecessary and disproportionate. It is simply not possible that it has been necessary for Israel to maintain its occupation since 1967 — for over 56 years. Moreover, Israel also cannot possibly justify its settlements upon and annexation of occupied territory as a necessary response to any perceived threat — not to mention the myriad of rights violations that are intrinsic to the occupation. By settling and annexing occupied territory, Israel has acted unnecessarily in using force.\n\nIsrael’s prolonged occupation is also wholly disproportionate to any legitimate aim. Israel’s occupation of the entirety of the Palestinian territories “long after the period in which any presumed armed attack... could reasonably be contemplated” makes it even more disproportionate now. And the manner in which the occupation has been conducted — including the establishment of an apartheid régime — renders the occupation disproportionate as well. In sum, Israel’s decades-long occupation violates the jus ad bellum and is therefore illegal."

        "texto": "THE COURT SHOULD NOT BE DETERRED FROM PROVIDING AN ADVISORY OPINION WHICH ANSWERS IN FULL THE QUESTIONS POSED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nMr President, that belief is one that is shared by the overwhelming majority of States and international organizations which have chosen to participate in these advisory proceedings. However, a small number of States — just five in total — contend that the Court should decline to provide an advisory opinion because, they say, an opinion would prejudice negotiations between the State of Palestine and Israel. A further handful of States — which include the United States, from whom you heard earlier today — do not go quite so far, but they instead urge the Court to exercise caution to avoid undermining the existing negotiating 'framework'.\n\nBoth the advocates of abstention and the advocates of timidity are wrong. There are several reasons why the possible effect of an advisory opinion on negotiations between Israel and the State of Palestine does not constitute a good — still less a 'compelling' — basis for either declining to issue an opinion or for restricting its scope. I highlight two in particular.\n\nFirst, the arguments all rest on a fundamentally flawed factual premise. They assume the existence of ongoing negotiations between Israel and the State of Palestine which could be prejudiced by an advisory opinion. But such negotiations do not exist. There have been no negotiations between the two States for a decade. There are no live negotiations.\n\nAnd this is not a contentious proposition. Indeed, one of the most prominent and vocal advocates of judicial caution, the United States, expressly concedes in its Written Statement that negotiations between the two States 'are not currently occurring'. This is the unfortunate but very real actuality.\n\nNor, if the words of Israel’s leaders are anything to go by, is there any realistic prospect of Israel’s willing participation in such negotiations in the near future. Recent public statements by Israel’s Prime Minister make this abundantly clear. In November of last year, for example, Prime Minister Netanyahu proclaimed that Israel would prevent a Palestinian State in Gaza and the West Bank. That was a position he reiterated emphatically in January of this year.\n\nThe second — and more fundamental — reason why the Court should not be deterred from issuing an advisory opinion which answers in full the questions posed by the General Assembly, is that the General Assembly, the Security Council and this very Court have all made clear that the Israel-Palestine conflict must be — and can only be — resolved in accordance with international law.\n\nIn November 2022, for example, the General Assembly adopted resolution 77/25 which '[s]tress[ed] that compliance with and respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law... is a cornerstone of peace and security in the region'. The General Assembly called upon Israel 'to comply strictly with its obligations under international law and to cease all of its measures that are contrary to international law' including measures which seek to 'prejudg[e] the final outcome of peace negotiations'. The resolution went on to refer to 'the illegality of the annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory... which constitutes a breach of international law... and challenges the prospects for the achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace'.\n\nIn other words, a just, lasting and comprehensive peace necessarily requires compliance with international law.\n\nIn a similar vein, in February of last year, the President of the Security Council issued a statement which emphasized that '[t]he Security Council reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions. The Security Council strongly underscores the need for all parties to meet their international obligations'.\n\nIn the Wall Opinion, the Court likewise stressed the importance of 'achieving as soon as possible, on the basis of international law, a negotiated solution' in order to achieve 'peace and security for all in the region'. In his concurring opinion in that case, Judge Al-Khasawneh stressed that 'it is of the utmost importance if... negotiations are not to produce non-principled solutions, that they be grounded in law'.\n\nThe principal judicial organs of the United Nations have spoken emphatically and with one consistent voice. They could not be clearer that any negotiations between Israel and the State of Palestine must be grounded in international law and must be aimed at ensuring a resolution of the conflict which is in accordance with international law. It is obvious and it is self-evident that an advisory opinion containing the Court’s answers to the questions of international law posed by the General Assembly will help, not hinder, the attainment of that end.\n\nIndeed, the very resolution which requested these advisory proceedings confirms that this is exactly what the General Assembly considers that an advisory opinion will help to achieve. Resolution 77/247 stressed the need to 'advanc[e] and accelerat[e] meaningful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a peace agreement that will bring a complete end to the Israeli occupation... and the resolution of all core final status issues... leading to a peaceful, just, lasting and comprehensive solution of the question of Palestine'.\n\nIn adopting this resolution, the General Assembly plainly considered that an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice would facilitate, rather than frustrate, 'negotiations' leading to 'a peaceful, just, lasting and comprehensive solution'.\n\nIt follows that the Court can and should answer the questions posed by the General Assembly confident in the knowledge that its answers will help to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict in accordance with international law."

        "texto": "Mr President, I turn now to an important issue of substance, namely whether as a matter of international law an occupation can be unlawful. The United States, as you heard earlier, contends that an occupation cannot be unlawful or lawful. It argues that occupation is governed exclusively by international humanitarian law, which is concerned only with the acts of the occupying Power and has nothing to say about the legality of the occupation itself. For the United States, when it comes to occupation international humanitarian law is both the start and the end; it is the only game in town.\n\nGuyana, like dozens of other States and international organizations, disagrees. Put simply, there is a distinction between the law of occupation, on the one hand, and the legality of an occupation, on the other. The conduct of an occupation is governed by international humanitarian law, while the legality of an occupation as a whole is determined by the United Nations Charter and general international law.\n\nThe argument advanced by the United States — that occupation is governed solely by international humanitarian law — leaves no room for the application of the Charter or general international law. In particular, it leaves no room for the principle enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the Charter that acquisition of territory by force is absolutely prohibited. An argument which leaves no room for the application of that fundamental principle of international law — a peremptory norm — is not a sound one.\n\nHow then does one determine whether Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory is unlawful? The answer, Guyana submits, is straightforward. It is to be found in the principle that occupation is inherently and exclusively a temporary state of affairs, and in the jus cogens prohibition on acquisition of territory by force.\n\nThe inherently temporary character of occupation is reflected in the principle that an occupying Power does not acquire sovereignty — “not one atom”, as Oppenheim memorably put it — over the occupied territory. It is also reflected in the duty of the occupying Power to preserve the status quo ante and to refrain from making any permanent changes to the occupied territory. Temporariness, in short, is the very core and essence of occupation. It is notable that none of the 57 States and international organizations which filed written statements in these proceedings contend otherwise.\n\nIt follows that permanent “occupation” is not occupation at all; it is military conquest. It is annexation. And annexation is, of course, strictly forbidden under international law. It therefore necessarily follows that an “occupation” which is intended to be permanent is unlawful under international law."

        "texto": "Applying these principles, Guyana submits that it is indisputable that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory is unlawful as a whole. The unlawfulness arises from the fact that Israel has annexed most of the occupied territory de jure and de facto, including by implanting almost three quarters of a million Israeli settlers in hundreds of settlements, which Israel’s leaders have promised never to remove.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Israel has formally declared sovereignty over the occupied territory and has expressly extended the application of its domestic laws to that territory. This is a classic, quintessential example of de jure annexation — and it is irrefutable evidence that Israel intends its occupation to be permanent.\n\nOver many years Israel’s leaders have repeatedly proclaimed East Jerusalem to be an inseparable part of Israel. In the words of Israel’s current Prime Minister, East Jerusalem “has been — and always will be ours” and “will remain only under Israel’s sovereignty”. This unequivocal declaration — and many others like it — have been accompanied by far-reaching actions. These include the systematic implantation of more than 230,000 Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem — an exercise in deliberate demographic manipulation that has profoundly changed the composition, the character and the status of the Holy City.\n\nIn the rest of the West Bank, Israel has conducted a similar, decades-long process of implanting half a million Israeli settlers in more than 270 illegal settlements. Those settlements, and the network of settler-only roads and infrastructure which connect them, form a vast interconnected constellation of illegal colonies, to which Israel has extended the application of its domestic laws. The intent — and the effect — is to establish permanent Israeli dominion throughout the West Bank. Indeed, the highest officials in successive Israeli governments have openly and brazenly declared an intention to exercise sovereignty over the entire West Bank, which they have renamed Judea and Samaria, and which they define as an integral and inseparable part of the land of Israel.\n\nIsrael has created, expanded and entrenched its sprawling network of settlements in the face of repeated condemnation of the illegality of those actions by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Secretary-General, a plethora of United Nations committees and rapporteurs, as well as the international community and, of course, this very Court.\n\nIsrael’s annexation of the occupied territory and its intention for the occupation to be permanent has been widely recognized and condemned by the United Nations. I offer five examples, but I stress that these are merely illustrative, and they are very far from exhaustive.\n\nFirst, literally dozens of General Assembly resolutions from the early 1970s onwards have expressly referred to and condemned Israel’s “annexation” of the occupied territory. Examples of those resolutions, which span a period of more than half a century, are listed in Guyana’s Written Statement. This vast corpus of resolutions demonstrates a clear, consistent and emphatic recognition by the General Assembly that Israel has unlawfully annexed much of the occupied territory with the intention of retaining it forever.\n\nSecond, multiple resolutions of the Security Council between 1968 and 2016 expressly recalled the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force and condemned Israel’s annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory on that basis. Examples of those resolutions are also listed in Guyana’s Written Statement. Those resolutions represent a clear recognition by the Security Council that Israel has annexed most of the occupied territory in contravention of fundamental principles of international law, and that it intends to exert perpetual control over that territory.\n\nThird, successive Secretaries-General of the United Nations have also repeatedly described and condemned Israel’s “annexation” of Palestinian territory in official published reports. In 2010, for instance, the Secretary General referred to “Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem” which is “a flagrant violation of international law”. In 2015, the Secretary-General reported to the General Assembly that: “In the West Bank... the establishment and maintenance of the settlements amount to a slow, but steady annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory.” Similar statements are once again cited in Guyana’s Written Statement.\n\nFourth, the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry has also concluded that Israel has illegally annexed much of the West Bank and intends the occupation to be permanent. In its September 2022 report, the Independent Commission concluded that: “Israel treats the occupation as a permanent fixture and has — for all intents and purposes, annexed parts of the West Bank.” The report went on to describe Israel’s “settlement enterprise” as “the principal means” used by Israel “to create irreversible facts on the ground” to support “its permanent occupation”. The Commission added that “[s]tatements made by Israeli officials provide further evidence that Israel intends the occupation to be permanent”.\n\nFifth, successive United Nations Special Rapporteurs have similarly concluded that Israel has annexed the occupied territory. In 2021, for instance, the Special Rapporteur reported that Israel’s occupation “has become indistinguishable from annexation”. He highlighted “the de jure annexation plans made by Israel” and he cited the “plentiful... evidence” that “Israeli policies and practices” are designed to pursue “a strategy of de facto annexation and permanent control over the Palestinian territory”.\n\nIn a report published the following year, the Special Rapporteur observed that the implantation of hundreds of thousands of settlers in the occupied territory was intended to “demographically engineer an unlawful sovereignty claim through the annexation of the occupied territory”. He concluded that Israel’s occupation had “burst through the restraints of temporariness long ago” and that “Israel has progressively engaged in the de jure and de facto annexation of occupied territory”.\n\nMr President, Israel’s annexation of Palestinian territory, and its clear intention for the occupation to be permanent, render the occupation unlawful as a whole. This has already been recognized by the United Nations. In 2022, the Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that: “there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is now unlawful under international law owing to its permanence and to actions undertaken by Israel to annex parts of the land de facto and de jure”.\n\nIn January this year, the Secretary-General, citing international law and the resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly, concluded bluntly that: “Israel’s occupation must end.” When the United States read aloud from the Secretary-General’s statement earlier today, it regrettably excised these crucial words. However, the State of Palestine read them to you on Monday. As the State of Palestine pointed out, the Secretary-General stated one month ago that: “Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully independent, viable and sovereign State realized, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements. Israel’s occupation must end.”\n\nGuyana emphatically agrees, both with the Independent Commission of Inquiry and the Secretary-General. The occupation is unlawful. The occupation must therefore end — immediately, comprehensively, irreversibly."

        "texto": "We put to the Court that there are compelling reasons to deny the request for an advisory opinion. All these reasons pertain to the issue of judicial propriety. The reasons include the specifics of the questions, the essentially bilateral nature of the dispute and the lack of consent of one of the parties, as well as the already existing legal framework for the resolution of pending issues and disputes between the parties.\n\nConsequently, the Hungarian Government is of the view that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\nThere are three compelling reasons for the Court not to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\nMr President, we now turn to the second issue: the compelling reasons why the Court should reject to give an opinion on the request made by the General Assembly.\n\nWe recall the existing precedent for rejecting a request for an advisory opinion based on compelling reasons. The predecessor of the Court, the Permanent Court of International Justice, declined to issue an advisory opinion on the status of Eastern Carelia. This decision has never been overruled. We note that the Court, in its subsequent decisions, has always taken due care to demonstrate the factual differences from the Eastern Carelia case when considering the exercise of its jurisdiction. This must lead us to the conclusion that the legal criteria set out in that decision remain authoritative.\n\nAs to compelling reasons, we would like to bring the Court’s kind attention to the following three considerations that individually, as well as cumulatively, may compel the Court to refrain from issuing an advisory opinion to the present questions.\n\nFirst, we express sincere doubt that the nature of the question would allow for an appropriate advisory opinion. While the title of the General Assembly resolution 77/247 speaks of “Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people”, the question posed in operative paragraph 18 of the resolution says: “legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination” and “related discriminatory legislation and measures”. The questions encompass a wide range of subject-matters, touching upon the legal status of the occupied Palestinian territories, the unspecified Israeli practices and the legal consequences of both the status of the occupied Palestinian territories as well as those practices. While the questions do not specify the actual practices and legislation, they already provide a distinct qualification stating their illegality and unlawful nature. Replying to these questions would inherently entail an affirmation of the statements incorporated in the question. Advisory proceedings were designed as an instrument to contribute to, and facilitate the work of, the requesting organs. These proceedings are not an appropriate forum for making the kinds of determinations that are implied in the question. As the Court put it in the Kosovo Advisory Opinion: Article 65 of the Statute of the Court has not created “a form of judicial recourse for States”. In our view, should the Court decide to reply to these questions in the form of an advisory opinion, that would be “tantamount to adjudication on the very subject-matter of the underlying concrete bilateral dispute that undoubtedly exists between Israel and Palestine”.\n\nThis leads us to our second consideration concerning the essentially bilateral nature of the dispute. At the outset, we duly take note of the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the conflict between Israeli and Palestinian parties is “located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute”. However, it must be pointed out that this “broader frame of reference” has fundamentally changed due to the shifting political dynamics within the conflict. The Wall Advisory Opinion was issued during ongoing peace negotiations between the parties that, alas, have not yielded the desired outcome. Unfortunately, in recent years, despite repeated calls for relaunching good faith negotiations between the parties by the international community, including this very Court, the process has stalled. Deadlock continues to ensue and the conflict thus remains an acute bilateral dispute between the parties.\n\nOn this basis, we argue that providing an advisory opinion would inevitably raise the question of circumventing consent of Israel as a party to this bilateral dispute. We refer to the fact that Israel voted against resolution 77/247 in the General Assembly in 2022. Israel’s attitude in the previous decades has demonstrated its readiness to participate in different negotiations and peace processes. This is the very way the esteemed Court itself suggested solving this dispute.\n\nFor these reasons, we recall our request for the Court to exercise its right to decline rendering an advisory opinion.\n\nAvoiding unduly politicization and maintaining the existing negotiating frameworks are necessary to uphold the judicial character of the Court.\n\nAs for our third and final query, we refer to the already existing and accepted institutional architecture for maintaining international peace and security. In this institutional fabric, each actor has its own distinct role and responsibilities, as institutional guarantors of peace and security. Within this intricate system, it is the United Nations Security Council that has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security according to the United Nations Charter. Should the Court decide to render an advisory opinion on this matter, this would — in our opinion — inevitably result in the unduly politicization of the esteemed institution of an otherwise strictly judicial character. This could threaten to undermine its ability to contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. Additionally, such an opinion, irrespective of its content, would inevitably become part of an already heated political debate, particularly in the aftermath of the barbaric Hamas terrorist attacks conducted on 7 October 2023.\n\nFurthermore, when discussing the institutional backdrop to this conflict, it must be pointed out, that there is, in fact, an established framework for negotiations aimed at the political settlement of the conflict, emanating from the various United Nations Security Council resolutions, such as resolutions 242 and 338. Moreover, to this day, this established negotiation framework, built around the Oslo Accords, remains the recognized framework by both parties to the conflict.\n\nIt is crucial to also mention the involvement of other international mechanisms and actors in the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO). The role of the Special Coordinator is important in facilitating dialogue and negotiations, promoting peace and coordinating international efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive resolution.\n\nTherefore, one must come to the conclusion that if we are to stay true to this very Court’s ruling issued in the Wall Advisory Opinion, what is needed today is not a new legal interpretation, but a renewed effort to restart peace negotiations, implementing in good faith all relevant existing United Nations Security Council resolutions."

        "texto": "In discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one must reflect on the broader political context.\n\nHungary recalls that in 2004 this esteemed Court clearly stated in its Advisory Opinion concerning the Construction of a Wall case that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties, on the basis of international law and through the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Since 2004, this fundamental approach has not changed, although numerous aspects of the political context have shifted. As Hamas came to power in 2007, it rejected fundamental pillars of the existing political framework, in particular the Quartet principles, including Israel’s right to exist, as well as renouncing violence as a means of achieving goals, and adherence to previous agreements between the parties. This has significantly affected the existing peace initiatives and has induced intra-Palestinian divisions that have proven difficult to resolve over the years.\n\nWe must also note more recent developments that have yielded significant change in the broader political dynamics of the conflict. The Abraham Accords established in 2020 provided a novel approach that has allowed for the normalization of relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries. We believe that in a political sense the Abraham Accords represented an effort to create a more conducive environment for the negotiated settlement of the conflict. Moreover, it aimed to provide a solid foundation for enhancing regional peace, prosperity and stability.\n\nUnfortunately, the progress of these promising developments were imperilled by the horrendous terrorist attacks conducted against Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023. What happened on 7 October was one of the worst terrorist attacks and sexual barbarism the world has seen in a hundred years. On that Saturday morning, innocent Israeli civilians were awakened by an unprecedented brutal terrorist attack, the launching of thousands of rockets, the torturing and killing of hundreds, among them babies, and Hamas taking more than 200 hostages. Hungary strongly condemns these horrific terrorist attacks and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. These actions are not just an attack on a democratic country—they represent an assault on all democracies around the world. These actions are not just a clear violation of international law, they are also crimes against humanity. Israel has since been fighting the terrorist organization Hamas, with the aim to eradicate terrorists and to prevent such horrific terrorist attacks ever happening again. The evil of terrorists is well shown by the fact that they use innocent civilians, education and healthcare facilities as shields. Sparing the lives of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians is of the utmost importance—now, as well as in the future, in the interest of a sustainable peace, free of terror.\n\nWe welcome that the esteemed Court has recently called for immediate and unconditional release of the hostages held by Hamas and underlined that all parties to the conflict must abide by international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Upholding the rules is non-negotiable. Nonetheless, we must also note that the proceedings brought before this esteemed Court may directly contribute to the escalation of the conflict. We are of the view that both the present proceedings, as well as the proceedings against the State of Israel in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip, may be considered as provocations in the ongoing conflict, not contributing to the de-escalation and an eventual settlement of the conflict. A potential utilization of the Court in the communication war could create newer dividing lines and could continue to fuel tensions in one of the most severe conflicts of recent history.\n\nBearing in mind this aforementioned broader context, let me now turn to addressing three main issues that Hungary considers important to highlight."

        "texto": "The other key problem that leads to continuous violations of human rights of Palestinians are the Israeli settlement activities. This policy, sometimes referred to as creation of “facts on the ground”, was launched back in 1967 and has led to progressive shrinking of Palestinian lands. This has effectively undermined prospects of a negotiated solution of the one element of the final status, namely the issues of territory and borders. The overall number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is over 700,000. The situation is exacerbated by other arbitrary moves by the Israeli authorities, such as confiscation of lands, demolition of homes and prohibition of new construction. Most recently, this has been accompanied by violence emanating from Israeli settlers.\n\nIn 2023, that is, after the present request for an advisory opinion was made, the settlement activities of Israel have gained a record-breaking speed. Thus, according to the latest report of the United Nations Secretary-General, in 2023, plans for more than 24,700 housing units were advanced, approved or tendered. This is more than double the 11,700 units in 2022, which in itself was a remarkable figure.\n\nDuring the current wave of violence, we have witnessed public statements by Israeli cabinet members announcing plans to resume settlement activities in the Gaza Strip. Thus, on 28 January 2024, at a conference in West Jerusalem, cabinet ministers openly called for deportation of Palestinians from Gaza and presented a map with 21 settlement blocs. One cannot help noting that the event was held two days after this Court indicated provisional measures in the South Africa v. Israel case. The Court agreed that the situation in Gaza poses risks of irreparable harm to the rights of Palestinians guaranteed by the Genocide Convention. This fact alone underscores the gravity of the situation.\n\nIn this connection, it is worth recalling that this Court, in its Advisory Opinion on the Wall, recognized that “the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) ha[d] been established in breach of international law”. As explained in that Advisory Opinion, the settlements are contrary to the principle of inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force. They also contradict the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibiting transfers of population and deportations from an occupied territory. Resolutions of the Security Council have characterized that policy as changing the legal status and geographical nature of the occupied territories, and materially affecting their demographic composition.\n\nIn its resolution 2334, the Security Council reaffirmed that the settlements “have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace”.\n\nThis policy is aggravated by numerous violations of other rules of international humanitarian law and human rights law. These include the right to life, to respect for private and family life, to property, to freedom of movement, to freedom of religion, to work, to health, to education, and to an adequate standard of living.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this policy continues unabated, in defiance of Security Council resolutions and the Quartet Roadmap12. Importantly, as stressed in resolution 2334, the settlements are “dangerously imperilling the viability of the two-State solution based on the 1967 lines”. They are thus also violating the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n\nIsraeli policies in Palestine, to Russia’s deep regret, include other international law violations. Many examples have been provided by other delegations here. The Russian Federation expects the Court to give them due consideration.\n\nThe continued Israeli occupation of Palestine impedes the realization of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination. Israeli settlements are contrary to the principle of inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force. They also run counter to the prohibition of transfer and deportation of population of an occupied territory. The settlement activities are aggravated by numerous other violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. All States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from Israel’s violations."

It must in particular cease all settlement activities and all other activities that impede reaching a final status agreement. At the same time, discussion on Israel’s responsibility must remain within the limits imposed by the advisory nature of these proceedings and to the need to create conditions for successful final status negotiations."

Russia supports the assessments given in the General Assembly resolution 77/247 and the respective reports of the Secretary-General. We also support relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council based on the reports of its Special Rapporteurs. In today’s statement, let me focus on two of the most important aspects.\n\nThe first one is the persistent denial by Israel of the right of Palestinians to self-determination. The right to self-determination through the establishment of an independent Palestinian State has been at the heart of efforts of the international community. This right has been recognized by the General Assembly, the Security Council and by this Court.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the principle of self-determination of peoples is one of the foundations of the United Nations, mentioned in the very first Article of its Charter. Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples of their right to self-determination. Meanwhile, as recognized by the General Assembly, the protracted Israeli occupation prevents the Palestinians from implementing that right.\n\n“An end to the Israeli occupation” has been identified as a goal for the international community by legally binding resolutions of the Security Council, including resolution 2334. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to cease its violations of international law and to allow the Palestinian people to establish an independent State. This necessarily means that the occupation must come to an end.\n\nIsrael and Palestine are under an obligation to conduct, in good faith and without delay, negotiations aimed at reaching a final status agreement. All States and international organizations are under an obligation to contribute to creating conditions for such negotiations. The agreement thus reached shall result in the implementation by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination and emergence of an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. This will bring an end to the ongoing violations of human rights of Palestinians and to the Israeli occupation."

        "texto": "President, Members of the Court, the Palestinian people have an inalienable right to self-determination and complete independence, which has always been systematically denied to them.\n\nThe League of Nations Mandate territories had a right to independence which was realized for all of them — except for Palestine.\n\nThe United Nations Charter enshrined the right to self-determination for the protection of all peoples except, in practice, for the Palestinians, more than half of whom were massacred or driven off their land in the 1948 Nakba. Their land was partitioned and half of it allocated to a new State that promptly extended it to 78 per cent by brute force.\n\nIn 1967, just seven years after resolution 1514, Israel commenced its still-continuing occupation of the entirety of the remaining Palestinian territory.\n\nSince then, Israel has, through its systematic manipulation of negotiations to undermine the presumed objectives, ensured that the Palestinian people are prevented from ever exercising that right.\n\nIsrael cannot be permitted to continue flouting one of the most fundamental principles of international law with impunity. Impunity breeds inhumanity.\n\nThe right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is violated in many ways. I will focus on three.\n\nFirst, the exclusion of Palestinians from any part of the Palestinian territory denies their right to territorial integrity, which is an essential part of the right to self-determination. The Palestinian people have a right to self-determination within the entirety of their territory.\n\nYet Israel has systematically removed and excluded Palestinians from parts of their territory. It has separated Gaza from the West Bank and prevented the free movement of Palestinians within the Palestinian territory. It has prohibited the return of Palestinians to their homes and property and established exclusionary illegal settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\n\nThis is especially egregious because many of these almost 700,000 State-supported settlers are continuously terrorizing and forcibly displacing Palestinians from even more of their territory and engaging in pogroms against them.\n\nSecond, Israel denies the existence of Palestinians as a people. The Israeli Minister of Finance, himself an illegal settler, has stated that “there’s no such thing as a Palestinian people”. Senior Israeli leaders routinely deny that the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination. Moreover, the case brought by South Africa which Belize fully supports lays bare the fact that Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza also denies the right of Palestinians to exist at all.\n\nOne key tactic in this regard is Israel’s deliberate use of starvation to destroy the civilian population of Gaza. Gaza’s entire population of more than two million people is in crisis, facing the “worst levels of acute food insecurity”. By December 2023, the famine threshold had already been exceeded and the situation was deteriorating rapidly. This famine is not an accident. Indeed, senior Israeli officials have already clearly stated their intent to deprive civilians in Gaza of food and water.\n\nIn its planned erasure of the Palestinian people, Israel is also destroying Palestinian cultural, educational and historical institutions in Gaza. Almost 400 schools and every single university have been partially or fully destroyed, including one which was used as a base and interrogation centre by Israeli forces for months before they pillaged it and then detonated it. The intention is to erase all traces of Palestinian life and culture, to destroy the very essence of what makes the Palestinians a “people”. The message is clear: the total culture of Palestine must be destroyed and they must have no future in Gaza.\n\nThird, Israel is using forcible action to deprive the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination, freedom and complete independence. This includes the right of the Palestinian people “freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development”. Israel’s forcible action that denies the right to self-determination consists of institutional, coercive policies and practices that exert authority over and oppress the Palestinian people. These include: the complete control exercised over Palestinian natural and economic resources; the institutionalized and racist apartheid and the systematic and excessive use of force, arbitrary killing and mass incarceration of Palestinians, including children.\n\nIt also includes action taken by Israel to deny Palestinian political participation by criminalizing political speech and membership of, or connection with, Palestinian political parties.\n\nAs the United Nations rightly says, by depriving Palestinians of their fundamental rights, Israel has taken away their “agency and ability to unite, self-govern and develop as a polity”.\n\nThe consequence of this breach is that Israel must immediately, unconditionally and totally withdraw from all of the Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael is determined to ensure that the Palestinian people do not now and do not ever exercise their right to self-determination. Israel considers itself an exception. No State reserves to itself the right to systematically violate the right of a people to self-determination  except Israel. No State seeks to justify the indefinite occupation of another’s territory except Israel. No State commits annexation and apartheid with impunity except, it seems, Israel.\n\nBut Israel must not be allowed such blatant impunity. It must not be allowed to continue to inflict scars for generations to come on those that survive this holocaust. Israel must be made to behave like all civilized nations, stop violating international law and United Nations resolutions, and respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n\nPalestine must be free."

        "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, apartheid is “the strongest concentration of racist concepts put into action”. It goes hand-in-hand with Israel’s violation of the right to self-determination. It is impossible to realize a people’s right to self-determination within an “institutionalised regime of systematic racial oppression and discrimination”. The dehumanizing nature of apartheid suppresses the equality, identity and dignity at the heart of self-determination.\n\nThe existence of apartheid is relevant to the first question before the Court, which asks about the “legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination... and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures”. Although the Court can opine on discrimination falling short of apartheid, there are significant and different legal consequences resulting from the breach of the prohibition of apartheid that arises on the facts before the Court.\n\nI will address the definition and scope of apartheid; apply the definitional elements to the facts; and set out the legal consequences.\n\nThe Apartheid Convention’s definition reflects custom and has the same content as the term “apartheid” in Article 3 of CERD. The prohibition of apartheid is not limited to southern Africa or commission by a particular State.\n\nThe prohibition also applies beyond a State’s territory. Article 3 of CERD refers to “territories under [a State’s] jurisdiction”, which includes situations of occupation. The CERD Committee has determined that Article 3 applies to the “Palestinian population in Israel... and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.\n\nFirst, it is indisputable that the Palestinians are a “racial group” for the purposes of CERD and custom. Under Israeli law, the separate identity of the Jewish race is afforded a privileged status and the right to exercise self-determination in the State of Israel is “exclusive to the Jewish people”. Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are perceived by themselves and by external actors as different racial groups.\n\nSecond, Israel’s deployment of a combination of measures across the Palestinian territory, and against the Palestinian people, falls within Article II of the Apartheid Convention. Israel has long-standing discriminatory laws, policies and practices that affect only Palestinians and are designed to benefit exclusively, and maintain the dominance of, Israeli Jews, on both sides of the Green Line. Moreover, many measures are designed to fragment the Palestinian people as a group, and to separate Palestinians from Israeli Jews. This is what Namibia rightly calls “strategic fragmentation.\n\nSuch measures have been set out in Belize’s Written Statement. Here, I emphasize two points. First, in the West Bank, there is the separation wall, restrictive permit requirements, checkpoints and segregated roads. This creates what the Israeli army officially calls “sterilization” areas and roads closed to Palestinians. “Hebronization” meaning the strategies of repression and segregation is spreading.\n\nSecond, Gaza is under siege and blockade. Millions of Palestinians are confined to ever-smaller strips of land the longest and most complete siege of the greatest number in modern history. The whole of Gaza has become an impoverished, desperate ghetto.\n\nSince 1967, Israel has detained one million Palestinians, including tens of thousands of children.\n\nIsrael’s conduct against the Palestinian people has been characterized as apartheid by United Nations Special Procedures since 2007, including a joint statement of 47 mandate holders in 2020.\n\nTurning to the third element of apartheid: intent. Israel’s measures are imposed “for the purpose” of establishing and maintaining dominance and systematic oppression. This can be inferred from their scale and institutionalized nature, and from the differing effects they have on the Palestinian and Israeli peoples as regards access to basic services and rights protection. It is also directly evidenced by Israeli laws that affirm Jewish supremacy as a “national value”. Intent is heard in the hate speech of Israeli public officials, and political and religious leaders. The Court has ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to members of the Palestinian group in... Gaza”. Intent is also evidenced by Israel’s suppression of dissent against the system of apartheid.\n\nIndoctrination starts in the classroom. The CERD Committee has expressed concern at the “tide of racist hate speech... in school curricula and textbooks”. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has pointed to “the extensive militarization of the educational system”, which is entrenched during compulsory military service. Israel’s State Comptroller has criticized the Government for “doing very little to purge the severe phenomena of racism and hatred among youth and to promote a shared society”.\n\nIf the requisite intent is established, any claimed security rationale cannot displace the conclusion that Israel’s conduct falls within Article II.\n\nIn the light of these violations of self-determination and the prohibition of apartheid, Belize requests the Court to formulate precisely what Israel and third States must do. Specific consequences facilitate accountability.\n\nBelize refers to the written pleadings that detail such consequences. The core consequence of the violation of the jus cogens right to self-determination and the prohibition of apartheid is immediate cessation; Israel must dismantle the physical, legal and policy régime of discrimination and oppression, including freeing political prisoners; evacuate Israeli settlers from Palestinian territories; permit Palestinians to return to their country and property; and lift the siege and blockade of Gaza. These consequences, taken collectively, mean that Israel must immediately, unconditionally and totally withdraw from the entire Palestinian territory. This legal consequence applies irrespective of the outcome of the Court’s consideration of occupation and annexation. Israel must also make full reparation for the damage suffered as a result of its violations.\n\nUnlawful occupation. On occupation, Belize makes three points. The first is that Israel is currently occupying all of the Palestinian territory. Secondly, the rules of international law applicable to determine whether the existence of that occupation is lawful are the rules on the use of force, the jus ad bellum. Thirdly, when those rules are applied to this occupation, it is evident that the occupation is neither necessary nor proportionate and is thus unlawful.\n\nIsrael is currently occupying all of the Palestinian territory.\n\nOn the first, Belize will concentrate today on Israel being in occupation of Gaza. That was the case before October last year and remains the case.\n\nIn July last year, Belize submitted that a State could be in occupation of territory even if it no longer has soldiers in it, if that State could “at any time they desired assume physical control of” the territory and had “the capacity to send troops within a reasonable time to make the authority of the occupying power felt”. That was a tragically prescient submission. Israel has since 7 October certainly made its power felt, and not just in the form of responding to the attack on it. Its recent conduct is a continuation and intensification of its long-term control over, violence against and incursions into Gaza. Israel controls who and what enters and leaves Gaza, including by air and sea, as well as the supply of water and energy. Gaza is under Israeli occupation and has been since 1967.\n\nJus ad bellum as the applicable law.\n\nI turn then to the rules applicable to determining whether Israel’s ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territory as a whole is lawful.\n\nThe position of the United States is that the jus ad bellum determines the lawfulness of territory becoming occupied, but not of its remaining occupied. On that approach, an occupying Power that has lawfully established an occupation would be unrestrained by law as to how long that occupation lasts. It would be restrained by the jus in bello as to how it conducts the occupation, but it would be under no legal restraint concerning the duration of the occupation. That would of course mean that an occupation could lawfully become indefinite, and that must be incorrect.\n\nThe correct position is that whether the existence of an occupation is lawful, either at the time of its commencement or as it continues, is determined by the jus ad bellum. That follows from the fact that an occupation is a use of force. Even if a use of force is initially necessary and proportionate, once either of those two conditions ceases to be met, the continuing use of force will become unlawful. That applies as much to occupations as it does to any other use of force.\n\nIsrael’s occupation of Palestinian territory is unlawful.\n\nApplying the rules on the use of force to this case, Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory in June 1967 has been unlawful from its inception.\n\nIn any event, Israel’s occupation is certainly not now necessary or proportionate. If the occupation was ever lawful, it was part of Israel’s use of force against Egypt and Jordan in 1967. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and so its occupation of Gaza has been unlawful since at least that time. Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994 and so its occupation of the West Bank has been unlawful at least since then.\n\nGuatemala has nonetheless argued in these proceedings that, in light of the events of 7 October, Israel should not be required to cease its presence in Gaza or the West Bank.\n\nConcerning the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on no conceivable basis could it credibly be said that Israel’s continuing occupation of the West Bank is a necessary or proportionate response to the recent attack by Hamas from Gaza.\n\nConcerning Gaza, Israel’s use of overwhelming force including its ongoing occupation of Gaza is plainly not a necessary or proportionate response to the October attack.\n\nIn enforcing its occupation, Israel is committing breaches of international humanitarian law, in both Gaza and the West Bank. They are not, however, the breaches that lead to the most important consequences in this case. The fundamental issue, from which the most important consequences follow, is that it is unlawful for Israel to be exercising any control at all in respect of Palestinian territory.\n\nThat brings us to annexation.\n\nWhether a State has unlawfully annexed territory depends on two things: first, whether the State has physically seized the territory, and second, whether it has an intention to make the territory its own.\n\nThe requisite intention can be evidenced by a formal declaration of annexation, but it can also exist implicitly if the State has “clearly manifested its intention to hold the... territory permanently under its dominion”. That is what the Court has described as “de facto annexation”.\n\nIn one form or another, Israel has annexed all of the Palestinian territory. This is clear from the map you have seen used by the Prime Minister of Israel before the General Assembly last September that showed the West Bank and Gaza as part of Israel.\n\nFor East Jerusalem, the position is the most straightforward, since Israel has formally annexed it under Israeli law.\n\nFor the remainder of the West Bank, it is hardly less obvious.\n\nIsrael has occupied the entirety of the West Bank for 57 years with no plan for withdrawal or acknowledgement of any need or intention to ever withdraw.\n\nOn the contrary, it has an increasingly active programme of settling hundreds of thousands of Israelis in hundreds of settlements in the West Bank. These are permanent settlements on land that Israel is treating as its own.\n\nIsraeli officials thus speak of all of the West Bank as land over which Israel is sovereign.\n\nThese statements are matched by Israel’s transfer of administrative powers relating to the entirety of the West Bank from its military to its civilian authorities. That is a clear manifestation of the progression from occupation to annexation.\n\nAll of this is in the context of Israel refusing to recognize the existence of the Palestinian people as a people, or their right to self-determination and Statehood.\n\nThese circumstances have led United Nations bodies and special procedures correctly to conclude that Israel is responsible for de facto annexation of the entire West Bank, and not only of the part of it that the Oslo Accords label Area C. Area C constitutes more than 60 per cent of the West Bank and as the Court has seen from the fourth map that Palestine’s Foreign Minister displayed, it is clear that Areas A and B comprise a collection of isolated enclaves that are not viable without Area C.\n\nConsequences for Israel\n\nTurning to the heart of the questions posed to the Court, which is legal consequences, Israel’s occupation and annexation of Palestinian territory are continuing wrongful acts. Israel is thus under an obligation to cease those acts.\n\nWhether in respect of occupation or annexation, the conduct that constitutes a breach of the prohibition of the use of force is Israel’s presence in or exercise of effective control over Palestinian territory.\n\nTo cease that wrongful conduct, Israel must entirely withdraw from Palestinian territory. That includes withdrawing its civilian population from the West Bank, ceasing the construction and expansion of settlements there, and dismantling existing settlements.\n\nIt must also repeal or render ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts, policies and practices that contribute to its exercise of effective control over Palestinian territory.\n\nThe Court could also usefully indicate that the establishment of settlements has had no legal effect and does not give Israel any rights in respect of the land on which they are located.\n\nAs to the important question of timing, the Court has previously recognized that the obligation of cessation requires immediate action.\n\nIn the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court drew attention to the need for efforts to initiate negotiations. Israel interprets this to mean that it can remain in Palestinian territory until a negotiated solution to the entire conflict is reached. Belize’s Written Comments are devoted to explaining why that is incorrect. The core difficulty is that Israel is not entitled to remain in breach of peremptory norms pending a negotiated solution. It is therefore crucial that the Court specify that Israel is required to withdraw from the Palestinian territory immediately, unconditionally and totally."

        "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, it is an honour to appear before you on behalf of the Plurinational State of Bolivia to address an issue of vital importance for the international community. Today, the world looks to this Court, the principal judicial body of the United Nations, which is empowered to determine the legal consequences arising from Israel’s continued violations of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination; from its prolonged acts of occupation; from its continued settlements and annexation of Palestinian territory, including measures which alter the demographic composition, character and status of the holy city of Jerusalem; and the adoption by Israel of related discriminatory legislation and measures, as requested by the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\nThe right to self-determination is enshrined in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter. In 1970, General Assembly resolution 2625, confirmed, as put by this Court in 2019, the normative character of its right under customary international law. Resolution 2625, the Friendly Relations declaration, confirmed that the duty of each State is “to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples of their right to self-determination and freedom and independence” and to “promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples”.\n\nThe continued siege of Palestinian people through Israel’s illegal occupation, annexation and colonization since 1948 has systematically and forcibly discriminated, displaced and fragmented the Palestinian people by deliberately denying them their recognized inalienable right to self-determination and their right to return to their homeland, where the State of Israel is now illegally established. The illegal Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories constitutes a denial of this right and, in this sense, Israel violates the right enshrined under international law.\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, this Court reminded Israel of its obligations under international law, reaffirming that it was “bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law”.\n\nBolivia considers that the General Assembly resolution 15 of August 2004 expands on fundamental aspects of this Court’s Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including as regards East Jerusalem and its surroundings. Accordingly, they form part of the context to be considered in relation to the legal consequences of Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory which we are analysing during this period at the Court.\n\nThus, Mr President, Members of the Court, Bolivia contends that by continuously depriving and denying the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination for 75 years, Israel is in clear breach of its international obligations.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, Article 2 of the United Nations Charter contains a general rule against the unlawful use of force and states that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. The prohibition of aggression is binding on all States, and it constitutes a peremptory norm of international law.\n\nOn 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), in which it insisted on the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and called for the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces.\n\nBy the same token, through resolution 252 of 21 May 1968, the Security Council reaffirmed the point, considering that “all legislative and administrative measures and actions adopted by Israel, including the expropriation of land and property therein, that tend to change the legal status of Jerusalem are invalid and cannot change that status”.\n\nIt is imperative to recall that the Security Council urged Israel to scrupulously observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law on military occupation, further reiterating that the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilians in Time of War applied to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem.\n\nIn particular, Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention protects against colonization of occupied territory by providing that “[t]he occupying Power may not carry out the evacuation or transfer of any part of its own civilian population to the territory occupied by it”.\n\nYet, the transfer of 750,000 Israeli settlers and the building of settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank have been deliberately carried out with the intention of acquiring the territory through de facto and de jure annexation, including through colonization, confinement and fragmentation of the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nNot only the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, but also the General Assembly, reaffirmed the principle of inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, condemned and rejected Israeli measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, the character and status of Jerusalem and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. States in their international relations must refrain from resorting to the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or coerce another State to subordinate it in the exercise of its sovereign rights and obtain advantages of any type.\n\nBolivia considers that Israeli colonial settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Syrian Golan, have been built by force, through the imposition of institutionalized, racially discriminatory régimes (including apartheid) and through the denial of the exercise of the right to self-determination in contravention of international law. As a result, they must be considered illegal. Similarly, Israel’s occupation results from an act of aggression and, as such, it must be considered illegal under both jus in bello and jus ad bellum.\n\nThe Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, in its 2023 study of the legality of the Israeli occupation, endorsed the growing body of evidence that Israel’s belligerent occupation of the Palestinian territory is illegal in so far as it denies the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right to an independent State of Palestine.\n\nThe occupying Power lacks the right of sovereignty over the occupied territory, as confirmed by the principle of permanent inviolability of the rights of the protected population in the event of annexation, which is enshrined in Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. The occupying Power cannot alienate the land or the properties of the occupied State.\n\nThus, Bolivia considers that the Israeli colonialist occupations are clearly illegal according to jus in bello, and are illegal occupations because there is a violation of the normative order and the legal régime of the occupation such as the principles of temporality, the prohibition of annexation by force, serious violations of human rights and the right to self-determination, inalienability of sovereignty and the prohibition of racial discrimination, apartheid and, more recently, genocide.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, Bolivia observes with concern that Israel’s actions of persecution, oppression and domination of the Palestinian people have been accompanied by systematic violations of fundamental human rights that have been observed by both the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. This includes a system of racial discrimination and a system of apartheid that has not abated despite repeated condemnations from the international community.\n\nThe Human Rights Council has repeatedly called for the immediate protection of Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in accordance with human rights standards and international humanitarian law. It has further stressed all policies and measures adopted by Israel to limit access of Palestinians to their holy sites, in particular in occupied East Jerusalem, on the basis of their national origin, religion, birth, sex or any other status, violate the relevant provisions set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil Rights and Political Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Times of War; these measures must cease. “Israel is under an obligation to cease its wrongful conduct”.\n\nThe international community has repeatedly condemned Israel’s actions, including through the United Nations, in so far as they hinder the exercise of the Palestinian right to self-determination. These have included the construction of illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, the construction of the separation wall in the West Bank, and other measures that affect the daily lives of Palestinians. Bolivia has consistently joined these condemnations.\n\nIsrael’s occupation, both in its means and its purpose, does not fall within the framework of legality established in international law. The de facto annexation of territory imposes restrictions on where Palestinians can live and travel, as well as a racially discriminatory legal and administrative régime that favours Israeli settlers and deprives Palestinians of their most basic rights.\n\nThe conclusion is unavoidable that Israel has used its prolonged occupation as a pretext to pursue its illegal objective of annexing the occupied Palestinian territories, in violation of the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, the Israeli occupation must be considered illegal in its entirety.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, the policies and practices of Israeli occupation in Palestinian territory are illegal and have legal consequences with obligations for Israel and for other States and the United Nations, since they violate the rights of the Palestinians as a people and of Palestine as a State and therefore they both demand the complete and immediate cessation of these illicit international acts."

The ongoing situation results in consequences, and obligations, for all States and for the United Nations.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, the international community has, including through the United Nations, repeatedly condemned and must continue to condemn Israel’s actions that hinder the exercise of the Palestinian right to self-determination, such as the construction of illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, the construction of the separation wall in the West Bank, and other discriminatory measures that affect the daily lives of Palestinians.\n\nIn this context, States and international organizations are under an obligation to prevent and take measures and co-operate to prevent Israel from continuing to violate the Palestinian right to self-determination and its discriminatory practices of domination and apartheid and to avoid any act of support for the genocide of the Palestinian people. These measures may include diplomatic actions, economic sanctions, political pressure and legal measures.\n\nStates have the obligation to contribute with separate or joint actions to the State of Palestine’s exercise of its right to self-determination. States parties to the Genocide Convention also have clear obligations to act to prevent, suppress and punish genocide, employing “all means reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible within the limits permitted by international law”, also clarified in the 2024 Ukraine v. Russia case.\n\nThe Plurinational State of Bolivia considers that the Presidential Declaration of the Security Council of 20 February 2023 firmly underlines the need for all parties to comply with their international obligations and commitments. In this sense, States have the obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the acts of occupation of the territories of Palestine by Israel, the impediment to the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, the prevention of discrimination, apartheid and genocide and avoid any act of complicity and action that contributes to the maintenance of these illegal situations.\n\nBolivia believes that all States must firmly oppose all unilateral measures that impede peace, including, among others, to refrain the arms trade, the construction and expansion of Israeli settlements, the confiscation of Palestinian lands and the “legalization” of settlements, the demolition of Palestinian homes and the displacement of Palestinian civilians. States have to reject the expansionist and colonialist policies that Israel has been developing for half a century, promoting a system of apartheid and constant suffocation and genocide against the Palestinian people, in violation of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the respective resolutions approved by the Security Council, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.\n\nAs a pacifist country, the Plurinational State considers that the only alternative to guarantee a just and lasting peace in the conflict between Israel and Palestine must be the obligation for all States to contribute to dialogue and negotiation, with clear expressions of political will from both parties, to achieve a two-State solution, consolidating a free, sovereign and independent Palestinian\n\nState as it is established with the pre-1967 international borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the relevant Security Council and the General Assembly resolutions. Following the principles of international law and peace, Bolivia recognized Palestine as an independent and sovereign State on 17 December 2010 along the 1967 border because it meets all the traditional criteria for statehood.\n\nAll States have common but differentiated responsibilities and the obligations to provide solidarity and assistance to the Palestinian people. Accordingly, and despite its economic limitations, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is making an important effort by sending a contingent of humanitarian aid, which we hope can reach its destination without objection from the occupying\n\nPower.\n\nBolivia further considers that the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice, as well as the relevant treaty bodies, must continue to call on Israel to comply with its obligations under international law, to cease the expansion of illegal settlements, and guarantee the full exercise, enjoyment and respect of the human rights of the Palestinian population.\n\nSimilarly, the United Nations has the obligation to implement all relevant resolutions and other necessary measures and additional resolutions to bring to an end to Israel’s illegal occupation and the present system of racial discrimination and apartheid.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, every day we witness atrocities and an increasing irreparable loss of lives of the Palestinian people; the news documents daily the suffering, we know not what legal consequences these international crimes may yield, as they continue notwithstanding the Order on provisional measures of 26 January 2024.\n\nWith its advisory opinion, the Court has the power to establish what these consequences are."

        "texto": "Moving to the first point, it is Chile’s position that the Court has jurisdiction to give the requested advisory opinion and that there are no compelling reasons for the Court to refuse to do so.\n\nAs already stated in its written statements, Chile considers that the fact that a legal question may also involve certain political aspects or the fact that the parties concerned should pursue negotiations does not bar the Court from its jurisdiction. Indeed, complex situations, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are precisely the ones that can benefit the most from a clarification of the applicable law by this Court.\n\nWith regard to the principle of judicial propriety, which has been a matter of some debate in these proceedings, Chile underscores the fact that, by their very nature, advisory opinions do not resolve contentious disputes, and does not share the view of a few other States that rendering an advisory opinion in this case would be at odds with the agreed negotiation framework dealing with the ultimate status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nWhile it is true that the Security Council has endorsed a political process based on a negotiation framework for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is also true that the Security Council itself has condemned.\n\n“all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, including, inter alia, the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant resolutions”.\n\nChile recalls that this Court, in the Namibia Advisory Opinion, was clear in stating that an international instrument, such as a Security Council resolution, “has to be interpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation”. The Court has also noted that resolutions of the United Nations organs need to be analysed “having regard to the terms of the resolution to be interpreted, the discussions leading to it and, in general, all circumstances that might assist in determining the legal consequences of the resolution of the Security Council”.\n\nThus, to argue that Security Council resolutions supporting the need for a negotiated two-State solution impede the exercise of the Court’s advisory jurisdiction is simply untenable. Indeed, it is quite clear from the language used by those resolutions and the discussions leading to their adoption, that any such negotiated solution precisely requires the cessation and non-recognition of Israel’s illegal activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It is difficult to understand how a legal opinion rendered by this Court, the purpose of which is precisely to determine the legal consequences of Israel’s behaviour in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, might be an obstacle for a prospective negotiated solution.\n\nIn addition, one should not lose sight of the fact that ongoing or prospective negotiations do not imply a suspension of the functions and powers of the Security Council or the General Assembly. Indeed, the purpose of the request for an advisory opinion in this case is precisely to assist the General Assembly in the exercise of its functions with regard to the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It is important to bear in mind that the General Assembly, in exercising its powers, can issue recommendations, the content of which is not restricted to calling the parties to agree on a negotiated solution.\n\nIn conclusion, Chile strongly supports the view that, by giving the requested advisory opinion, the Court will be acting within the scope of its advisory function, fulfilling its duty to provide the legal assistance that the General Assembly requires to exercise its power in the context of a long-standing conflict."

        "pregunta": "The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
        "texto": "In its first written submissions, Chile referred to some of the evidence before the Court which demonstrates that Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Gaza, amount to serious and reiterated violations of international law, inter alia, of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, of the rules and basic principles of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law, including the prohibition of racial discrimination.Examining these violations is especially relevant in the present context of escalating hostilities. The upsurge of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Israel is partly explained by decades of systematic disregard of international law. Less than four months before the Hamas terrorist attacks, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson noted that Israel’s policies, including its attempts to exercise sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory “risks an uncontrollable explosion of violence on both sides”. The statement proved premonitory.\n\nNoting that the current escalation of hostilities is partly explained by the status quo does not entail condoning the attacks of Hamas. Chile unequivocally condemns terrorist actions and has called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages since day one. However, as noted by the United Nations Secretary-General, the escalation “does not come in a vacuum”, but grows out “of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year long occupation, and no political end in sight”. This further confirms the importance of determining the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violations of international law.\n\nAs Chile explained in its first written submission, there is vast evidence demonstrating the existence of serious violations of international law by Israel. Although Chile agrees with other States in noting that the Court does not need to make detailed findings on every incident mentioned throughout the submissions and in the more than 1,800 documents contained in the dossier filed by the Secretary-General, I would like to point to certain particularly serious violations which the Court should address in its advisory opinion.\n\nFirst, Israel has violated and continues to violate human rights law, including the denial of the Palestinian people’s self-determination, a norm of jus cogens nature118. The evidence is clear including the establishment and expansion of settlements, the confiscation of Palestinian land and arbitrary demolition of Palestinian houses, and the unwillingness and inability of Israeli authorities and officials to protect the Palestinian population from violence in breach of Israel’s obligations as an occupying Power. The Human Rights Committee the views of which have been given significant weight by the Court in the past regretted that “Palestinians have been systematically deprived of their land and housing rights for decades”, expressed concern for the “systematic practice of demolitions and forced evictions based on discriminatory policies” and noted that such practices “led to the separation of Jewish and Palestinian communities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which amounts to racial segregation”.\n\nThese violations have worsened after the October 7 attacks. Israeli human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) Yesh Din has noted that “2023 was the most violent year in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank in both the number of incidents and their severity”, and that the first two months after 7 October 2023 “were particularly violent”. Similar findings were made by Israeli NGO B’Tselem, Human Rights Watch and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also noted the rapid deterioration of the human rights situation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem after 7 October, including unnecessary and disproportionate use of force resulting in unlawful killing, mass arbitrary arrests, detentions and ill-treatment, and a further rise in settler violence, already at record-high levels. In parallel, high-ranking Israeli authorities have expressed that they have no intent to guarantee the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination in Gaza, by stating that “[t]he State of Israel will no longer be able to accept the existence of an independent entity in Gaza” and by calling for the re-settlement of the Strip.\n\nIsrael has not only violated the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination but also other rules of international law, including the jus ad bellum, by its de jure and de facto annexation of Palestinian territory. As developed in more detail in Chile’s written submissions, and as eloquently put by former Special Rapporteur Lynk, “the inexorable Israeli occupation has become indistinguishable from annexation”. Chile agrees with the views of most participants in these proceedings, in noting that Israel neither regards itself nor behaves as a temporary occupant of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and that its practices and policies are inconsistent with a temporary administration of occupied territory.\n\nIsrael’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory also amount to serious violations of Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law (including the prohibition of transferring civilian population into the occupied territory, which also amounts to a war crime), and under the rules of international human rights law, that forbid racial discrimination. This latter point has been repeatedly noted by authorities including the Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Special Rapporteurs, among others. In his 2023 Report to the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner documented “patterns of systematic discrimination in law, policy and practice, encompassing almost every sphere of life in particular, housing, land and property rights and the right to life, security of person and access to justice”. Already in 2019, the words of Prime Minister Netanyahu were crystal clear on this point: “Israel is not a State of all its citizens Israel is the nation State of the Jewish people and only it”.\n\nBefore moving to question, I want to note one additional feature of the abovementioned violations: Israel has incurred them in blatant disregard of repeated admonitions by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Court itself.\n\nFurthermore, as noted in February 2023 by the President of the Security Council, it is clear that Israel’s practices actually run contrary to the possibility of reaching a two-State solution and a sustainable peace in the region.These violations, among others, detailed in Chile’s written statements, trigger Israel’s international responsibility. Thus, Israel is under the obligation to cease these violations, make full reparation and offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. These violations also impose on other States various related obligations, including the obligation to co-operate to bring this situation to an end through lawful means. Chile is precisely co-operating to bring this situation to an end by participating in these advisory proceedings, and by its joint submission with Mexico of a referral to the International Criminal Court on the situation in Palestine."

        "texto": "In addressing question (b), it is important to distinguish it clearly from question (a). As previously explained, question (a) is concerned with the legal consequences arising from the violation by Israel of various international law obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nThe second question is of a different nature. Question (b), focuses on the legal status of the occupation, that is to say, on the illegality of the occupation itself. In this regard, if the Court finds that the occupation is unlawful, it necessarily follows that the occupation must come to an end.\n\nThe conclusion that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal, lies on two grounds. First, there is ample evidence, as we have heard from States’ oral presentations during these two days, that the occupation has become an annexation. Second, the cumulative effect of the abovementioned systematic violations also requires the end of the occupation as the measure needed to effectively protect the rights of the Palestinians.\n\nWith regard to the legality of an occupation, the test put forward by former Special Rapporteur Lynk is particularly useful140. According to this test, the occupier cannot annex any of the occupied territory, the occupation must be temporary, and the occupant must seek to end the occupation and return the territory as soon as reasonably possible.\n\nThe de jure and de facto annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory by Israel contradicts the basic principle of no acquisition of territory by force. In this regard, General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) establishes that “[t]he territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force”; and that “[n]o territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”.\n\nThe principle of no acquisition of territory by force has been applied by this Court in relation to States, with regard to mandated territories, and in relation to peoples and their right to sovereignty and integrity of their national territory.\n\nThis Court has recognized that the territorial integrity is a key element for the exercise of the right of self-determination through which peoples freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social and cultural development. In fact, the Court in the Chagos Advisory Opinion has considered there is an intrinsic link between territorial integrity and self-determination, such that “any detachment, [or annexation like in this case,] by the administering Power of part of a non-self-governing territory, unless based on the freely expressed and genuine will of the people of the territory concerned, is contrary to the right to self-determination”.\n\nOccupation is often the result of armed conflict and, in so far as one of the main purposes of humanitarian law is to protect the civilian population that lives in areas affected by war, humanitarian law imposes various obligations upon the occupying Power, precisely to prevent the violation of their basic rights and the conquest of their territory.\n\nIn this context, Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contains an absolute prohibition of the annexation of occupied territories. In this case, the intention to annex the territory of the Palestinian people is demonstrated by the fact that the Israeli occupation has already expanded for a period of 56 years with no intention to put an end to it and with no satisfactory explanation as to the relation between occupation and the protection of its citizens. The policy and practice of settlements pursued by Israel since 1967 indicate its intention to claim that its own population has a right to stay permanently on these territories. Similarly, its exploitation of Palestinian natural resources also demonstrates Israel’s attempt to exercise sovereign powers over the Occupied Palestinian Territory. As an occupying Power, Israel is obligated to act as a temporary administrator on behalf of the protected population and as such it cannot destroy or appropriate these resources. However, the fact that it has completely sequestered them145 clearly shows that Israel does not conduct itself as a provisional occupying Power.\n\nIndeed, by virtue of its actions, including the exploitation of natural resources, the policies of settlements, the erection of the Wall, the legalization of outposts, among others, Israel has demonstrated its intention to control indefinitely the Occupied Palestinian Territory, hence, Israel’s occupation has become an annexation.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, turning now to the cumulative effects of the violation of self-determination, humanitarian law, human rights law and international criminal law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Chile contends that these systematic breaches are also a basis to declare that the occupation is illegal. Again, Special Rapporteur Lynk’s test is useful in this regard. According to this test146, the legality of an occupation requires the occupier to act in the best interests of the people under occupation and to administer the occupied territory in good faith, including acting in full compliance with the duties and obligations under international law.\n\nIt is important to clarify that not any violation of international law by an occupying Power leads to the conclusion that the occupation must come to an end. As was previously stated, occupation might be the result of an armed conflict and, in that context, it is the responsibility of the occupying Power to prevent and punish any act in breach of international law undertaken by its armed forces and persons under its control. In so far as the occupying State fulfils its duty to prevent and punish the individual perpetrators, the violations will not by themselves raise the question of the illegality of the occupation.\n\nBut in this case, the systematic violation of international law is part of a State policy, and then we think that the occupation has become illegal.\n\nTherefore, during this illegal occupation, the obligations of the occupying Power obviously persist, despite the fact that this occupation must come to an end."

        "texto": "First, on the matter of jurisdiction and competence, the small number of States objecting to the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction have variously argued that the request is politically motivated, instrumentalizes the Court, circumvents the consent of Israel, covers too vast a scope or will prejudice the peace process and negotiations between the parties.\n\nLet me recall that the Court has repeatedly and consistently rejected such arguments. In the Kosovo Advisory Opinion, the Court did not concern itself with the motives which may have inspired the request or the political implications of its Opinion. Since the General Assembly is duly authorized under Article 96 of the United Nations Charter, and brought forth its request through a validly adopted resolution, the request, in the Court’s own words, “in principle, should not be refused”. In the Nuclear Weapons and Chagos Advisory Opinions, the Court refused to secondguess the decision of the General Assembly, stating that it “has the right to decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own needs”.\n\nDistinguished Members of the Court, the General Assembly has turned to this august Court with what is manifestly a legal question, seeking a legal answer that would indisputably assist in discharging its functions. Allow me to recall that this very Court in the Wall Opinion affirmed the United Nations’ “permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine” until such time as it may be “resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy”.\n\nIn the Wall Opinion, the Court found no merit in the proposition — echoed by some in these proceedings that the ongoing negotiations constituted a compelling reason to decline its competence. It reached a similar conclusion in the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, after noting that its opinion would “have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element on the matter”.\n\nIndeed, rather than prejudicing the peace process, the present advisory opinion serves not just as an “additional” element but rather an “essential” one for the General Assembly to continue to carry out its role in relation to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This is absolutely critical given the complete absence of any real prospect for a peaceful solution.\n\nThe Court could not possibly turn its back on this wealth of jurisprudence or disregard the many compelling reasons for it to honour the General Assembly’s request, as summarized so aptly by the representative of Palestine. The Middle East region yearns for peace and stability and a just, comprehensive and lasting resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the principles of international law, and the establishment of a viable Palestinian State on the pre-1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The legal determination by the Court in the present advisory opinion is indispensable to guide the General Assembly and the international community to achieve this objective."

        "texto": "Second, Mr President, I turn to the question of the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. 14. Distinguished Members of the Court, Palestine has been subjected to the longest protracted state of occupation in modern history, as well as de facto and de jure annexation that confirm the unlawful nature of the occupation28. 15. Israel’s persistent policy of implanting settlements in the West Bank and occupied Jerusalem for the purpose of creating facts on the ground and breaking up the territorial contiguity of the occupied territories, is a blatant disregard for international law. Twenty years ago, the representatives of the State of Palestine laid before this Court the facts of Israel’s intensive settlement and colonization policy, which had, at the time, transferred 400,000 illegal settlers to the occupied Palestinian territories. Today, that number stands at 750,000, deliberately and permanently altering the status of the occupied territories. 16. In addition to the policy of de facto annexation, Israel purported to annex East Jerusalem de jure through the Basic Law adopted by the Israeli Knesset in 1980, stipulating “Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel”. 17. The very limited number of States defending these policies advance two principal claims, namely that “the legal status of occupation” does not change if the occupation is prolonged or involves illegal violations of jus in bello29 and that under jus ad bellum, Israeli occupation is lawful since, inter alia, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions did not declare otherwise.\n\nEgypt submits that the proposition that occupation is, merely, a de facto situation whose legality cannot be called into question is seriously flawed. As highlighted by a number of participants, the legality of an occupation must be assessed by reference to the United Nations Charter and general international law.\n\nIn fact, Israel’s prolonged occupation violates a number of distinct legal régimes that exist and operate simultaneously and concurrently. These include: the law of occupation, part of the jus in bello, that is characterized by this Court as “intransgressible”; the jus ad bellum and the peremptory prohibition of the acquisition of territory through force; the principle of self-determination, also a peremptory norm of international law, described by this Court as erga omnes and “irreproachable” in the East Timor case; and the fundamental prohibition of racial discrimination, segregation and subjugation.\n\nIt is against this legal framework that the legality of Israel’s policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories must be assessed.\n\nFirst, with respect to the jus in bello, it is a fundamental principle of international law that an occupying Power is prohibited from changing the status of the occupied territory, as well as its annexation, in whole or in part. It is only entitled to exercise limited powers, intended to be temporary in nature, with the aim of balancing between its own military needs and the protection of the local inhabitants. These are not rights bestowed on the occupying Power, but rather limitations on its authority.\n\nIt flows from this that belligerent occupation is governed by two key principles. First, it is a temporary régime and, second, it cannot transfer sovereignty to the occupying Power. Rather, it freezes the legal order of the occupied territory throughout the duration of the occupation. The occupying authority is merely a de facto administrator, a principle intended to protect both the inhabitants of the occupied territory, as well as “the separate existence of the State, its institutions and its laws”. This is reflected in Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and is precisely what “distinguishes occupation from annexation”.\n\nThe prohibition of permanently changing the occupied territory extends also to its demographic component. Article 49 of the Fourth Convention prohibits “individual or mass forcible transfer” of civilians outside the occupied territory; and the transfer by the occupying Power of “parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. According to the 1958 Commentary, this was intended “to prevent a practice adopted during the Second World War by certain Powers, which transferred portions of their own population to occupied territory for political and racial reasons or in order, as they claimed, to colonize those territories”.\n\nAs demonstrated in Palestine’s statement, there is overwhelming evidence that Israeli support for and maintenance of settlements is intended to permanently alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and extend Israeli sovereignty over it. This is coupled with Israel’s mass forcible transfer and forced displacement of the Palestinians in Gaza, through its illegal evacuation orders and indiscriminate use of force, which has been labelled by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as “ethnic cleansing”.\n\nIt should be highlighted that Article 49 not only prohibits forced transfers, but also, in the Court’s own words, “any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory”.\n\nNumerous resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council affirmed the illegality of Israel’s settlements, annexation and measures altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem considering them invalid and a flagrant violation of the Fourth Convention, while requiring Israel to desist from such practices38.\n\nSecurity Council resolution 298 stated that “all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status”.\n\nThe Security Council also declared in relation to Jerusalem in resolution 478 (1980) that Israeli “legislative and administrative measures are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith”. Israel remains in defiance of these and subsequent resolutions, including resolution 2334 (2016) and numerous General Assembly resolutions in addition to the provisions of the Geneva Conventions previously described.\n\nIsrael’s prolonged military rule and its strategic settlement policy, considered a “national value” under Israeli legislation, is essentially a systemic “de-Palestinianization” of the occupied territory, including Jerusalem, intended to permanently change its demographic characteristics, and enhance its Jewish component, thereby achieving the de jure and de facto annexation of that territory. This leads to the conclusion that Israeli occupation is, in fact, an illegal annexation, conquest and de facto colonial endeavour.\n\nMr President, the second legal principle by which the legality of Israel’s occupation is to be assessed, is Article 2 (4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibits the acquisition of territory through force; one of the most fundamental principles of the post-UN Charter era.\n\nThe vast majority of States participating in these proceedings submit that Israeli occupation by virtue of its permanence, de jure and de facto annexation manifestly violates the principle of inadmissibility of acquiring territory through force. Only one State has attempted to justify Israel’s actions, by contesting the Palestinians’ title to the occupied territories and justifying Israel’s territorial expansion as the product of a defensive war43.\n\nEgypt submits that these claims have no basis in fact or in law and seek to derail the Court by raising issues outside the temporal scope of this request. They are reminiscent of the archaic international law of the nineteenth century that justified territorial conquest through denying the sovereign status of colonized peoples, relegating them to the realm of terra nullius.\n\nThere is, also, no support for the proposition that Israel was acting defensively in 1967. International law recognizes neither pre-emptive nor preventive self-defence and the terms of the United Nations Charter on this matter are clear, requiring an armed attack to occur in order to trigger the right of self-defence. Israel’s attack in 1967 was, therefore, not a defensive but an aggressive war.\n\nEven if the claim of self-defence were valid — which clearly is not the case — a decades-long occupation is not reconcilable with the customary international law conditions of necessity, immediacy and proportionality44. In any event, the issue is a moot one, as it is universally recognized that a State may not gain title to territory through any use of force, regardless of its purported legitimacy.\n\nThese claims also find no basis in Security Council resolution 242, which unequivocally recognized the inadmissibility of acquiring territory through force, demanding Israel’s withdrawal from territories occupied in the recent conflict and emphasizing the duty of all States to act in accordance with Article 2 of the Charter. Resolution 242 was reaffirmed by resolution 338, while the inadmissibility of territorial acquisition through force was confirmed in at least nine subsequent Security Council resolutions. In fact, resolution 471 clearly stated, as far back as 1980, the overriding necessity to end the prolonged occupation of the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 including Jerusalem.\n\nIn Egypt’s view, it is clear that under international law, the territorial status of the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip cannot lawfully be altered through armed conflict.\n\nIsrael’s protracted occupation, which is coupled with measures to permanently change the demographic characteristics of the occupied territory, and annex parts of the land de facto and de jure in violation of the cardinal principle of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory through force, is therefore, illegal per se and an ongoing violation of international law."

        "texto": "Distinguished Members of the Court, the third legal principle against which Israel’s conduct must be assessed is self-determination. Egypt submits that Israel’s indefinite occupation amounts to a nullification and denial of the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination.\n\nIt is indisputable, that this right — enshrined in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter and both human rights Covenants is a cardinal principle in modern international law. Its erga omnes character, confirmed by the Court in the East Timor case, entails that all States and international organizations have a legal interest and a duty in respecting and protecting this right.\n\nThis Court already affirmed in the Wall Advisory Opinion the applicability of this right to the “Palestinian people”.\n\nMr President, Israel’s indefinite occupation of the Palestinian territories is as a whole inconsistent with the principle of self-determination and breaches three salient aspects of this principle. First, it obstructs the Palestinian people from freely determining their political status, achieving independent statehood, sovereignty and the right of return.\n\nSecond, it deprives Palestinians of their right to pursue their economic, social and cultural development. In gross breach of international law, Israel restricts Palestinians’ access to Jerusalem’s Christian and Muslim holy sites, notably Al-Aqsa Mosque, wantonly depletes Palestinian natural resources, imposes access restrictions to “Area C” and obstructs the movement of goods and people between the West Bank and Gaza, stunting Palestine’s economy and impeding the geographical unity of the State of Palestine.\n\nThird, the fragmentation and dismemberment of the occupied territories, through Israel’s settlements policy, the wall and measures of de facto and de jure annexation, are a blatant violation of the fundamental principle of the integrity of the self-determination unit. The territorial unit of Palestine includes both the West Bank, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Although Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005, it still retains effective control by, inter alia: exercising complete control over Gaza’s airspace and territorial waters; the flow of people and goods in and out of Gaza; the Palestinian population registry; and the tax policy and transfer of tax revenues. Israel’s continuing military incursions into Gaza, including the ongoing brutal assault, indicate Israel’s continuing authority over the territory. Together, the West Bank and Gaza constitute a single territorial unit. This has been confirmed by numerous Security Council resolutions which refer to Gaza as an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 and of the Palestinian State under the two-State solution.\n\nEgypt firmly denounces the ongoing obstruction of the Palestinian people’s inalienable, permanent and unqualified right to self-determination, a violation — as argued by Palestine — that is an “essential feature” of Israel’s prolonged occupation.\n\nOne only needs to look at Israel’s vicious, wholesale destruction of Gaza today, after years of imposing the medieval methods of siege and blockade, to realize the extent of Israel’s transgression of this principle. Israel’s prolonged occupation is therefore illegal, per se, and is an ongoing, internationally wrongful act that must be immediately brought to an end by Israel, by immediately ending the occupation.\n\nThe fourth legal principle against which Israel’s conduct must be assessed is the fundamental prohibition of racial discrimination, segregation and subjugation.\n\nOn a daily basis, under occupation, Palestinians face institutionalized discrimination and segregation under a dual legal system, applying different laws to Palestinians and Israelis. Israeli military orders in the occupied territories entrench racial discrimination between Palestinians and Israeli settlers. Israel also implements de facto and de jure measures of racial discrimination, including in the areas of detention, criminal justice, housing, land confiscations and house demolitions. How can such practices — which have been described by a number of participants as “crimes against humanity” — how can they be consistent with any notion of human rights and human dignity in the 21st century?\n\nIsrael is under an obligation to repeal all such legislation that maintains its systematic, oppressive and institutionalized policy of racial discrimination and segregation against the Palestinian people, and to cease all discriminatory policies and practices.\n\nI now turn to whether self-defence or military necessity may justify Israel’s prolonged occupation.\n\nThe argument that a State may exercise self-defence against a territory under its own military occupation and effective control is counter-intuitive, particularly since the occupying State has the authority and even the obligation to “ensure public order and safety” in the occupied territory.\n\nIn the Wall Advisory Opinion, this Court found that Article 51 of the Charter, which recognizes the inherent right of self-defence, had no relevance, as the acts invoked by Israel were acts arising out of the occupied Palestinian territory, which is under Israeli effective control and not imputable to another State. Egypt finds no reason for the Court to depart from this considered Opinion in the current proceedings.\n\nThe Court also rejected the justification of military necessity. The modern conception of military necessity is strictly limited to the contexts in which it is expressly recognized. It is thus already considered in the formulation of the obligations set out in humanitarian conventions, some of which “expressly exclude reliance on military necessity”.\n\nFor example, no military necessity qualification is permitted under Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the transfer of any part of the occupying Power’s civilian population into an occupied territory. This cannot be justified as a safety measure taken by Israel in the exercise of its prerogatives as an occupying Power.\n\nAccording to the legal maxim ex injuria jus non oritur, one should not be able to profit from one’s own wrongdoing. Israel thus cannot invoke self-defence to maintain a situation created by its own illegal conduct, or to justify violations of peremptory norms of international law.\n\nDistinguished Members of the Court, for how much longer do the Palestinian people need to wait before they are able to exercise their legitimate rights under international law? For how much longer will the United Nations continue to manage the humanitarian impacts of Israeli violations, without addressing their root cause? History will judge us for how we respond today.\n\nEgypt respectfully submits that the Court should advise the General Assembly that: the prolonged Israeli occupation is, per se, a continuing violation of international law for its breach of: the jus in bello; the prohibition of the acquisition of territory through force; the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; and the prohibition of racial discrimination, segregation and subjugation.\n\nIsrael — as the wrongdoing State is obliged to make full reparation through restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, by ceasing immediately and unconditionally its unlawful occupation of Palestinian territory, and rescinding the associated unlawful policies and practices of annexation, settlements and discriminatory legislation.\n\nAll States have a duty not to recognize the illegal situation created by Israel’s ongoing violation, resulting from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the occupied territory, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.\n\nMr President, the consequences of Israel’s prolonged occupation are clear, and there can be no peace, no security, no stability, no prosperity in the Middle East, without upholding justice and the rule of law for the Palestinian people. I thank you."

In other words, questions “framed in terms of law and rais[ing] problems of international law”, whereby the Court is asked to identify and apply principles and rules of international law, qualify as questions of a legal character.\n\nColombia considers that the questions raised in resolution 77/247 are indeed framed in legal terms, since they request the Court to determine the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of the State of Israel, a Member State of the United Nations, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to ascertain how those actions affect the legal status of the occupation. Those questions are to be answered through the application of rules of international law and therefore constitute legal questions which could form the basis of a request for an advisory opinion.\n\nThus, in the opinion of Colombia, the Court has jurisdiction to respond to the questions contained in resolution 77/247."

        "pregunta": "Decides to comply with the request for an advisory opinion",
        "texto": "Mr President, I will now focus on the question of propriety. In this respect, while Article 65, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, gives the Court discretionary power to give or not an advisory opinion that has been requested from it, in its case law the Court clarified certain important points, namely:\n\nthat the Court may give an advisory opinion should be interpreted to mean that the Court has always a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion, even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met; and the Court is always mindful of the fact that its answer to a request for an advisory opinion represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\n\nWhile certain States have expressed opposition to the request by the General Assembly, the reasons argued are, for the most part, quite similar to those dismissed by the Court in its Advisory Opinion on the Construction of a Wall. In that case the Court decided to render the requested Opinion as, in its own words “[d]ifferences of views on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding”.\n\nColombia posits that the Court’s thorough reasoning then, soundly grounded on its long-standing jurisprudence, is directly applicable to the current request.\n\nConsequently, Colombia considers that the Court should reach the same conclusion in the present proceedings, that is, that it can and will exercise jurisdiction, and that there are no compelling reasons for it to use its discretionary power not to render an opinion.\n\nHence, Colombia invites the Court to pronounce the law on the legal consequences arising out of serious breaches of peremptory norms of general international law and thus assist the General Assembly in the proper exercise of its functions; the United Nations in discharging its responsibilities in this matter, originating, as the Court recalled, in the Mandate and the Partition resolution concerning Palestine; and all States who possess an interest in the protection of erga omnes obligations.\n\nMr President, an additional important circumstance that should be factored in by the Court when deciding as to the propriety of rendering its advisory opinion is that the situation in the Palestinian occupied territory has changed drastically since the request was transmitted to the Court in January 2023.\n\nOn 7 October of the same year Israel was the victim of a horrifying attack by Hamas. We all know the scale and the magnitude of Israel’s reaction to the attack. The Court itself has already been confronted with the veritable map of horror and devastation which the Gaza Strip has become, as a result of the total war and scorched-earth policies unleashed by the Government of Israel.\n\nIndeed, in several passages of its Order of 26 January concerning provisional measures in the case brought by South Africa against Israel on 29 December 2023, the Court took judicial notice of some details of this dire situation. To quote just one of such passages, in the Court’s own words:\n\n“The Court considers that the civilian population in the Gaza Strip remains extremely vulnerable. It recalls that the military operation conducted by Israel after 7 October 2023 has resulted, inter alia, in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries and the destruction of homes, schools, medical facilities and other vital infrastructure, as well as displacement on a massive scale The Court notes that the operation is ongoing and that the Prime Minister of Israel announced on 18 January 2024 that the war ‘will take many more long months’. At present, many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have no access to the most basic foodstuffs, potable water, electricity, essential medicines or heating.”\n\nEvidently, the factual matrix of that case and the background of these advisory proceedings are not identical and, in particular, the request by the General Assembly has a wider scope than South Africa’s Application in at least two respects: in that the requested advisory opinion refers to the policies and practices of Israel in the whole Palestinian Occupied Territory and not only in the Gaza Strip; and in that it covers all actions that Israel carries out in such territory and not only the actions and omissions by State agents that, according to the Applicant in the contentious case, amount to genocide.\n\nBut the point remains that those policies and practices — which in Colombia’s view contravene essential norms of international law — have taken a turn for the worse as a result of Israel’s military campaign unfolding in Gaza, today a place of death and despair that, in the words of an impartial source, “has simply become uninhabitable”.\n\nColombia respectfully submits that the Court should not underestimate the fact that the situation in Gaza has become more deadly over the past months and, therefore, the legal consequences of such actions must be even more serious today than in the world we were living before this bloodshed started.\n\nAgainst that distressing background, and for all the reasons explained above, the Government of Colombia, in line with its policy of pursuing Total Peace both within and beyond its borders, calls upon the Court to avail itself of the opportunity to clarify legal aspects that may pave the way for the parties to resume a fruitful discussion and achieve peace, and support the General Assembly to better assist them in that purpose."

        "texto": "Mr President, let me address now the questions submitted to the Court by the General Assembly. The questions relate to the legal consequences arising from Israel’s ongoing violation of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people as a result of its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, and for all States and the United Nations from this ongoing occupation.\n\nIn order for the Court to rule on those questions, it must first determine whether Israel is violating the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, and whether Israel’s prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory since 1967 is in violation of international law. An answer in the affirmative to both questions will then enable the Court to address the ensuing legal consequences.\n\nWith regard to the first issue, as mentioned, in the Wall Advisory Opinion the Court stated that Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and, in doing so, it is obliged to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law. The General Assembly routinely reaffirms such right by means of an annual resolution on the matter.\n\nRegarding the second point, Israel’s prolonged occupation and further annexation of the Palestinian territory is in manifest violation of the rule of international customary law which clearly prohibits the acquisition of territory by force. It also blatantly ignores the United Nations Charter and the findings of this Court in its Advisory Opinion on the Wall case.\n\nAn occupation that includes the annexation de facto of the occupied territory amounts, in Colombia’s view, to an illegal acquisition of territory by use or threat of force, and to a denial of the right of self-determination. Furthermore, the occupation violates peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, as the Court recalled in its 2004 Advisory Opinion, Israel’s policies and practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are contrary to the terms of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party.\n\nGiven that the Israeli occupation has since its onset been acquisitive in nature and, consequently, its policies and practices in furtherance of that occupation have resulted in imposed persecution, racial discrimination and apartheid over the Palestinian people, it can only be found to be in breach of various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel."

        "texto": "Mr President, with regard to the consequences of those violations, Colombia is of the view that Israel’s actions contrary to international law engage its responsibility and therefore entail distinct legal consequences.\n\nFirst of all, Israel is obliged to cease its violations and to return to a situation of compliance with the obligations it has breached. Consequently, Israel is bound to put an end to the prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory. It must do so unconditionally, immediately and completely. It must cease the continuing internationally wrongful acts, and should offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. Israel also must respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law vis-à-vis the Palestinian people.\n\nMoreover, Israel must make reparations for the damage caused. The Court’s jurisprudence on the essential forms of reparation in customary law is clear. Israel likewise has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material or immaterial damage as a result of its occupation upon the Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael also has violated erga omnes obligations, and as the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature “the concern of all States” and “in view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection.”\n\nGiven the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, it follows that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the occupation of the Palestinian territory. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such occupation. As the Court has asserted, “it is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end.”\n\nFinally, Colombia believes that States must co-operate within the multilateral framework of the United Nations. In the present situation, the Organization, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further and urgent action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting, in the instant request, from Israel’s illegal occupation. The Court’s guidance is crucial for that purpose."

In this regard, the Republic of Cuba believes that, rather than an obvious apartheid régime situation, prosecuted as a crime against humanity, this is indeed an act of low-intensity genocide that is perpetrated with systematic and effective cruelty. To qualify Israel’s actions merely as acts of apartheid would leave out the implicit intention to exterminate the Palestinian people, either in part or as an ethnic and religious group to whom the right to self-determination is denied.\n\nIn case there was any doubt about the arguments that Cuba presented to the Court in its brief, the current situation that is taking place in the eyes of all confirms the ongoing genocide.\n\nInnocent victims, girls, boys, women, civilians in general, number in the thousands.\n\nFor the Genocide Convention to apply, the life of one single victim, or the incitement, attempt or conspiracy to commit such acts would be enough.\n\nThe Convention against Genocide also punishes the accomplices and instigators; those who veto decisions and prevent the international community and the United Nations from taking action; those who oppose an immediate ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid; those who, for years, have supported each and every one of the policies and practices of Israel, the occupying Power, which deny the existence of the Palestinian people and their rights. This agenda, to a large extent, has advanced in the course of time.\n\nWe are convinced that this Court should not wait for the complete extermination of an entire nation before ruling on the matter. That was the intention of the United Nations General Assembly in requesting the advisory opinion.\n\nThe terrible situation currently facing the Palestinian people is a reminder of the urgency of a clear and consistent statement on the questions submitted to the consideration of the Court.\n\nIsrael, the occupying Power, and its allies, must take responsibility for the legal implications resulting from the sustained non-compliance with the international law.\n\nConsequently, the analysis of the international responsibility of Israel should go hand in hand with the responsibility of the United Nations and the Member States that hinder its actions, creating by sustained and continued omission an international wrongful act that aggravates and worsens a clear situation of violation of international law in the Palestinian occupied territories.\n\nThere should be a clear and unanimous ruling by the Court that impartially and independently establishes the legal implications resulting from depriving the Palestinian peoples from their fundamental rights, including the right to life, freedom and self-determination."

These agreements state that “no party shall commence or take any step that would modify the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, pending the outcome of negotiations on the permanent status”.\n\nThe destruction and appropriation of property in occupied territories, which are not justified by military necessity and are carried out on a large scale, unlawfully and arbitrarily, constitute grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and therefore constitute a war crime.\n\nThe Palestinian question demands a clear statement on the legal implications resulting from the non-applicability and violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nLand, sea and air blockades constitute collective punishment and are extreme violations of freedom of movement and the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nCollective punishment is expressly prohibited by international humanitarian law and is incompatible with several international human rights law provisions.\n\nThe written submission presented by Cuba to this Court provides well-documented evidence, particularly the serious violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n\nThe genocide against the Palestinian people is not limited to the current stage of the extermination war by Israel. All this with the complicity of the United States of America, which prevents the international community from acting to protect the Palestinian people. The justifications for fighting terrorism and exercising the right to self-defence are deceitful when they are raised by the aggressors themselves.\n\nThe legal consequences of current and past events should not be analysed in a fragmented manner.\n\nTaken as a whole, this institutionalized violence, which makes no distinction between civilians and combatants, is part of a broader policy that also includes, in a systematic and organized manner: massive confiscations of land and property, unlawful killings, extrajudicial executions, torture, administrative detentions, forced transfers, restrictions on movement and the denial of nationality and citizenship to the Palestinian population.\n\nThere is also a discriminatory economic and cultural policy aimed at impoverishing the Palestinian population and denying the realization of their fundamental human rights."

This prohibition applies regardless of whether the territory is acquired as a result of an act of aggression or self-defence.\n\nThe United Nations Charter, which is the basic international legal instrument for the new international order and the contemporary international law, is very clear in this regard.\n\nThis treaty, of which the Statute of the International Court of Justice is an integral part, establishes in Article 2.4 that every State “shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.\n\nThe Charter itself, in Article 1.2, recognizes as one of its purposes “respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples”, which are systematically and flagrantly denied to the Palestinian people.

All of the foregoing is without prejudice to the applicable provisions of treaty law.\n\nIn addition, the International Court of Justice should separately address the international responsibility of other States for the aid and assistance they offer to Israel including those that supply weapons.\n\nIt is an undisputed fact that certain Members of the Organization violate the principles reflected in Article 2 of the Charter, not only by denying the sovereign equality and rights of the State of Palestine, but also by acting in bad faith in such a way that precludes any possibility for a negotiated solution to the conflict that, far from being resolved, has worsened over the last 70 years.\n\nIn all these years, the United States has systematically and consistently overused its veto power to prevent any effective action by the Security Council and to ensure impunity to Israel. Just yesterday, the United States vetoed for the 48th time a Security Council resolution related to the Palestinian question.\n\nThe International Court of Justice should emphasize the scope of Article 2.5 of the United Nations Charter, which states that all Members “shall refrain from giving assistance to any State against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action”.\n\nThis entails the obligation of all States to abide by the decisions adopted by the Organization as a whole, particularly when the Security Council remains passive by the indolent attitude of one of its permanent members, the United States of America, and the United Nations General Assembly has continuously and categorically taken a stand on this question, supported by the International Court of Justice."

This vision necessarily includes the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian State, as reaffirmed most recently by the Security Council in resolution 2720 of 22 December 2023.\n\nThe viability of this vision of peace and of an independent Palestinian State are imperilled by Israeli violations that are the subject of the present proceedings. Since the General Assembly’s request to the Court in December 2022, these violations and the level of violence have risen sharply.\n\nWe convene today while Israel’s grave violations against Palestinians persist with impunity, four months into its military operation in Gaza and following four failures by the Security Council to call for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, an increasingly brutal Israeli régime of systemic subjugation in the West Bank compounds Palestinian suffering. The horrors that have unfolded over the last few months, the 7 October attack on Israel, the destruction of the Gaza Strip, and the oppression in the West Bank underscore the desperate need for realizing the two-State solution. In the context of this grim reality, the Court’s advisory opinion is appropriate, it is urgent, and it is necessary.\n\nFar from prejudicing the negotiating framework, the Court’s opinion will reinforce the contours of the two-State solution. Indeed, that solution must be consistent with international law. In the Wall Opinion, the Court recognized that a negotiated solution and the establishment of a Palestinian State, alongside Israel, must be on the basis of international law57. This is also what the Security Council reaffirmed most recently in resolution 2720.\n\nThese pronouncements make clear that a negotiating process could not, and must not, lead to a result that is contrary to international law. And it is self-evident that a negotiating process that results in the contravention of peremptory norms of general international law would be void. By their very nature peremptory norms are non-negotiable. The fact that a solution is negotiated does not mean that it should not be principled.\n\nBy responding to the questions posed by the General Assembly as regards Israel’s violations and their consequences, the Court will be advising on legal questions directly relevant to the two-State solution. In so doing, the Court will aid efforts to realize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. This could not be more pressing.\n\nMoreover, as the State of Palestine observed in its oral statement on Monday60, the Court’s exercise of its advisory function can and has served to advance deadlocked negotiations, as occurred with its Chagos Opinion.

        "texto": "Mr President, the 56 years of occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have been shaped by Israel’s consistent grave violations against the Palestinian people. The UAE is confident that the Court has before it ample evidence to assist its identification of those violations and determination of their legal consequences. As I turn to my second point, I will outline briefly how the situation has severely deteriorated since July 2023.\n\nUnder international law, the Gaza Strip is occupied territory61. Gaza is also one of the most densely populated places on Earth.\n\nFor over four months now, and after enduring 17 years of blockade, its population of over 2.2 million has been under siege, faced with severe restrictions on water, food and other essential goods. The level of human suffering faced by civilians in Gaza, predominantly women and children, is on a scale seldom seen in the modern era.\n\nIsrael’s indiscriminate attacks on the Gaza Strip have caused massive civilian casualties and the extensive destruction of homes, schools and hospitals. Some 75 per cent of Gaza’s total population is displaced. I note here, Mr President, the latest orders issued to the Israeli Defense Forces to plan for the evacuation of Rafah ahead of another military offensive. That offensive would leave the approximately 1.5 million displaced Gazans taking refuge in the city with nowhere to go. These plans have been met with the international community’s resounding rejection.\n\nIsrael has imposed a policy of collective punishment against the Palestinian people, in violation of Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel has repeatedly issued so-called evacuation orders that in effect seek to transfer Palestinians forcibly, in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nIsrael has also failed its duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population in Gaza, in violation of Article 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel has further failed to protect the wounded and the sick, in violation of Article 16 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nEach passing day is met with further violations of international humanitarian law.\n\nAnd while the eyes of the world are trained on its brutal military operation in Gaza, Israel’s violations in the West Bank have intensified. As submitted to the Court, a number of Israeli acts in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, constitute grave breaches under the Fourth Geneva Convention62. Israel’s conduct also violates the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which lies at the heart of these proceedings63.\n\n2023 was by far the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since the United Nations began keeping records — more than tripling the previous high in 202264.\n\n2023 also saw the highest levels of settler violence yet recorded by the United Nations65. The freedom of movement of Palestinians has been severely impacted, including for Palestinian farmers seeking to harvest their lands in the West Bank66. Demolitions of Palestinian property have also reached their highest levels. This puts into stark relief the magnitude of this latest iteration of the Israeli settlement enterprise that erodes key components of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, including the denial of access to ancestral lands and control over natural resources.\n\nIn addition, there has been an intensification of Israeli settlement construction that undermines the viability of the two-State solution. According to the Secretary-General, 2023 saw the highest reported level of Israeli approvals and support for settler housing in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\n\nI raise these recent developments to underline that the violations at the core of the questions posed by the General Assembly are not static. After decades of violent dehumanization, dispossession and despair, the breaches resulting from the Israeli occupation in all parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory are worsening at an alarming pace.\n\nI will now focus on Israel’s long-standing violations in East Jerusalem."

        "texto": ". Jerusalem is “a city of unique cultural and religious depth and texture” that has occupied, through history, a place “at the crossroads of cultures and civilizations”.\n\nThe City of Jerusalem has the unique feature of being sacred for all three Abrahamic religions and is home to a host of Holy Places. This feature has put a special imprint on the city’s character. And the international community has accordingly underlined the need to preserve Jerusalem’s unique spiritual and religious dimensions.\n\nIf Jerusalem has throughout its long history represented one thing, it is tolerance. In the words of UNESCO, “[m]ore than any other place in the world, Jerusalem embodies the hope and dream of dialogue between cultures, civilizations and spiritual traditions, a dialogue through which mutual understanding between peoples may flourish”. Such is the unique historical nature of Jerusalem that an Israeli official once cautioned that “[a]nyone depriving Jerusalem of these contrasts, anyone upsetting the equilibrium by trying to make one factor predominant over another would make Jerusalem cease to be herself”.\n\nJerusalem is a place of enormous significance to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. On account of their artistic, religious and historical value, the Old City and the Holy Places are of exceptional importance to all humanity.\n\nJerusalem’s unique character has given rise to specific legal obligations as regards the rights of religious communities, including “specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places”. Since 1757, it has been the case that whoever holds Jerusalem is bound by this legal and historic status quo.\n\nAs early as 1948, the Security Council urged all governments and authorities concerned “to take every possible precaution for the protection of the Holy Places and of the City of Jerusalem, including access to all shrines and sanctuaries for the purpose of worship”. The concerns that motivated the Council then still remain. In 2023, the Security Council called “for upholding unchanged the historic status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem in word and in practice”.\n\nIsrael has, in agreements with Jordan and with the Holy See, committed to the historic status quo and freedom of access to the Holy Places in Jerusalem. In the Wall Opinion, the Court relied on such bilateral agreements, observing that they were part of the specific guarantees of access to Holy Places.\n\nIt is therefore gravely disconcerting that Israel has taken, and continues to take, measures which undermine the special character of Jerusalem and erase its cultural heritage.\n\nIsrael is in breach of its obligations by repeatedly interfering with the Holy Places and hindering freedom of access to them. Since the start of the occupation in 1967, Muslims and Christians have been impeded from worshipping at their holiest sites.\n\nAlso in breach of the historic status quo are Israel’s excavations in Jerusalem. Excavations and tunnelling, particularly in and around the Old City, imperil its historical, cultural and religious character.The works are carried out despite the serious risks to the integrity of Muslim and Christian Holy Places. The General Assembly has determined that these acts are flagrant violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nTurning to the question of settlements, the “ring” settlements in East Jerusalem contribute to “the further isolation of the city from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory”. They thereby undermine the viability of East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestinian State. This is fast becoming a fait accompli.\n\nMr President, Israel’s measures to extend its administration and laws to East Jerusalem are inconsistent with the most fundamental tenets of the law of occupation and the right to self-determination. Indeed, Israel’s administration of East Jerusalem constitutes annexation of territory on which the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination. International law is unequivocal in this respect: all measures by Israel that affect or aim to alter the status of East Jerusalem are null and void and have no legal effect on its status.\n\nBy resolution 478 of 1980, the Security Council affirmed that Israel’s enactment of the Basic Law was a violation of international law. Resolution 478 was plainly intended to be legally binding on Israel and all United Nations Member States. A binding determination by the Security Council to the effect that a situation is illegal must have consequences. As the Court noted in the Namibia opinion, “it would be failing in the discharge of its judicial functions if it did not declare that there is an obligation to bring [such a] situation to an end”.\n\nIsrael’s violations in East Jerusalem and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory threaten the viability of the two-State solution and go to the very nature of the occupation.\n\nIt is in this context that I come to the legality of the occupation itself. The Security Council reaffirmed in 1980 “the overriding necessity for ending the prolonged occupation of Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967”. The General Assembly has declared that “the Arab territories occupied since 1967 have continued to be under illegal Israeli occupation”.\n\nIsrael’s occupation is — as the vast majority of participants in these proceedings have recognized — illegal and must end. Israel’s occupation breaches the requirement, under the law of occupation, that an occupation must be temporary and cannot become permanent. It is in breach of the cardinal principle, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, that the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible. Israel’s occupation furthermore violates peremptory norms of general international law, such as the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. Mr President, whether the illegality of Israel’s occupation is determined under general international law or under the Charter, the conclusion is the same: it is illegal.\n\nIsrael’s illegal acts cannot remain without consequence. Which takes me to my last point."

First, Israel has, inter alia, an obligation to comply with the primary obligations it has breached; an obligation to ensure cessation of those breaches; and an obligation to make reparation for the damage caused by those breaches. Let me illustrate these obligations with a few examples.\n\nThis means that Israel must cease all policies and practices impeding the exercise of the Palestinian right to self-determination and repeal all laws and regulations that aim to alter the demographic composition, character and status of East Jerusalem. It also means that Israel must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places and respect the legal and historic status quo.\n\nThis means that Israel must comply with all its obligations as the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. For example, Israel must bring into the Gaza Strip the necessary food and medical supplies to the Palestinian population, and it must end its siege and all practices depriving Palestinians of supplies essential to their survival. In practical terms, it must mean a ceasefire.\n\nIt also means that Israel must stop its so-called evacuation orders and forcible transfers of Palestinians. It means that Israel must dismantle settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and must prevent violence perpetrated by settlers — many of them armed — against Palestinians. And it means that Israel must put an end to its settlement activities, its confiscation of land, demolition of homes, and the transfer of new Israeli settlers to the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nFinally, Israel must also comply with all decisions of the Security Council, in line with Article 25 of the United Nations Charter. This includes the binding decisions in resolutions 478, 2334, 2712 and 2720."

Second, States are under an obligation to co-operate to bring to an end Israel’s serious breaches. Additionally, States parties to the Geneva Conventions must ensure respect for those Conventions.\n\nThese obligations may translate into different actions from one State to another. The UAE believes that diplomatic engagement and dialogue can be effective tools to encourage compliance and cessation of unlawful conduct. But where these tools fail, third States’ obligations remain, as do the other instruments of the international system, including the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Court that sits in this Great Hall of Justice.\n\nAs the Permanent Representative of a country that has just completed its term on the Security Council, I wish to invite the Court to consider the following: the obligations to co-operate and to ensure respect for international law carry implications for States in the exercise of their vote on the Security Council. Voting against or preventing the adoption of a Security Council resolution that seeks to put an end to serious breaches of international law cannot be compatible with such obligations.\n\nIsrael’s violations also have implications for international organizations. The organs of the United Nations can and should take all steps within their respective mandates with a view to ensuring an end to those violations. The UAE remains firmly committed to play its part in supporting the principles of international law which underpin the international system.\n\nThe UAE considers that the Court’s advice on the questions before it is critical. Indeed, we believe it matters for all States — large and small — who rely upon and seek to preserve our international order. The reason it matters is quite simple: the even-handed application of international law is essential if that order is to function. To allow otherwise, to permit States to pick and choose what international law to apply and when, risks destabilizing our international order."

        "texto": "Bangladesh has long reiterated the call to end Israel’s occupation of Palestine and to achieve a lasting and permanent solution, which entails the establishment of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State along the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We firmly believe that the Court must heed the long overdue call to holistically examine Israel’s occupation and render an opinion on the legal status of the occupation as a whole. /n/nThe ongoing war represents one of the most shameful catastrophes in the history of the modern era. The United Nations agencies and other humanitarian aid organizations on the ground have warned of a “humanitarian disaster” engulfing the tiny enclave of 2.3 million people, with shortages of food, fuel, drinking water and medicines, worsening by the day. The killing of thousands of innocent civilians, particularly children, the destruction of their homes, the occupation of their ancestral lands and the deliberate obstruction of their access to food and water all constitute blatant violations of international law and serve as textbook examples of ethnic cleansing. /n/nWe elaborated on these matters and the underlying reasoning in our submissions before the Court, Mr President, on 24 July and 25 October last year. It is pertinent to recall that, just four months back, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, in her report, brought up several appalling facts. I would consider it apt to quote one pertinent aspect: “[I]n the occupied Palestinian territory, the fundamental right to life is under threat, as indicated by the mortality rates of Palestinian children: the neonatal mortality and infant mortality rates in the occupied Palestinian territory are, respectively, 9.3 and 12.7 per 1,000 live births, rising to 14.8 per 1,000 live births for children under 5, while in Israel they are 1.7, 2.7 and 3.4 per 1,000 live births. In addition to direct attacks on the right to life, Palestinians also endure structural violence and racial discrimination, which impedes their full development.” /n/nThe structural violence of the occupation and the deliberate and excessive use of force against the Palestinians are indeed not limited to the recent events in Gaza. As the Special Rapporteur Ms Albanese stated in her 2023 report: “[t]he spectre of death looms as a dominant element in the lives of Palestinian children. This reality exerts a psycho-social toll on those who manage to survive, as poignantly expressed by Ouadia, a 14 year old girl, ‘fearing death does not prevent you from dying, but it prevents you from living.’” /n/nOn Israel’s illegal occupation, Mr President, Members of the Court, the fundamental question posed by the United Nations General Assembly regarding the legality of the Israeli occupation is grounded in established international norms and legal principles. The State of Palestine, in its written statement, underscores the colonial and acquisitive nature of the occupation, emphasizing its deleterious impact on the Palestinian people. The occupation, characterized by persecution, racial discrimination and apartheid, stands in clear violation of three peremptory norms of international law: the right to self-determination, the prohibition of acquiring territory by force and the prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid. /n/nNumerous submissions have echoed these sentiments, highlighting the temporary nature of belligerent occupation as mandated by international law. The annexation of occupied territory and the settlement of the occupying Power’s nationals in the occupied area are explicitly prohibited, constituting illegal acquisition of territory under the United Nations Charter and relevant United Nations resolutions. /n/nIsrael’s prolonged occupation, coupled with its policies of colonization and annexation, underscores its illegality under international law. These actions not only contravene the United Nations Charter but also violate general international law, including the peremptory norm prohibiting the acquisition of territory by force. /n/nFurthermore, arguments put forth by States and international organizations reject any justification for Israel’s occupation on grounds of self-defence. The occupation violates fundamental principles of international law, including the right to self-determination and the prohibition of acquiring territory by force. /n/nThe Advisory Opinion on Wall, which concluded that Israel cannot rely on self-defence to justify its actions, reinforces the notion that the occupation cannot be justified under international law. /n/nWhile the countries supporting Israel in these advisory proceedings have primarily focused on jurisdictional questions, a few States have addressed the merits of the occupation. One contends that an occupation can never be unlawful, regardless of violations of international humanitarian law. However, this argument stands in contravention of established legal principles and has been widely found to be incorrect. /n/nSwitzerland’s distinction between the “law of occupation” and the “legality of an occupation” further elucidates the legal framework surrounding the issue. An occupation that involves annexation or de facto control of the occupied territory constitutes an illegal acquisition of territory by force, as prohibited under international law. /n/nUltimately, Israel’s occupation, characterized by its acquisitive, colonial and annexationist nature, represents a clear violation of international law. It serves as a means for the illegal acquisition of territory and must be brought to an immediate and unconditional end. /n/nI may also recall the United Nations Security Council resolution 2334 of 23 December 2016, which reaffirmed the obligations of Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention128 in regard to the protection of civilian persons in time of war. /n/nThat Security Council resolution also condemned all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, including, inter alia, the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant resolutions. Israel has flagrantly violated this and all other Security Council resolutions and it continues to do so in furtherance of permanently maintaining its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. /n/nTherefore, applying one or both of these frameworks, which Bangladesh endorsed for the reasons stated in our written submissions, we would respectfully submit that Israel’s occupation is undoubtedly illegal. I will now turn to the legal consequences. /n/nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the promise of a Palestinian State based on a diplomatic settlement grounded in law has been a prominent feature of the international agenda since 1948. Seventy-five years later, there exists a vast body of State practice and opinio juris that emphatically support the Palestinian people’s right to an independent State. The UN Security Council and the General Assembly have adopted numerous resolutions since 1948 on the “Question of Palestine”, recognizing, among other rights, the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the right of Palestinians to establish an independent State along the pre-1967 borders. Additionally, both the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Council have acknowledged the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. Importantly, in 2004, this Court, in its Advisory Opinion on the Wall, explicitly affirmed the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination under international law. /n/nThe Court’s steadfast commitment to universally uphold the rule of law, coupled with its principled stance on the legality of Israel’s half-century “temporary” occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, would shine a light of hope on the beleaguered Palestinian people. A decisive determination by the Court of the illegal status of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, and the legal consequences that arise from such status, including an immediate, unconditional and complete end to the occupation, would help secure the identity, respect, dignity and existence for the present and future generations of the Palestinian people, in a State of their own, at peace with Israel."

Indeed, in the Advisory Opinion on the Construction of a Wall, the Court confirmed that the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the United Nations Charter reflect customary international law. In 1966, the International Law Commission noted that the law of the United Nations Charter concerning the prohibition of the use of force in itself constitutes a conspicuous example of a rule of international law having the character of jus cogens84. Consequently, the International Law Commission included the prohibition of aggression in its list of rules of jus cogens85. /n/nAn occupation which fulfils the requirements of the right of self-defence may be considered as lawful under jus ad bellum. An occupation which does not fulfil, or no longer fulfils, these requirements may lose its legal basis and, hence, violate the jus cogens prohibition of the use of force. /n/nFinally, the Kingdom underscores that occupation is an inherently temporary use of force, because if it were to be permanent, it would qualify as annexation. As the Security Council emphasized in 1967, in its unanimously adopted resolution 242, the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible89. The Court recognized the customary status of the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force in the Advisory Opinion on the Construction of a Wall90. /n/nAccording to the Court, “a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and ‘elementary considerations of humanity’” that they are “to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law”91. In the Court’s view, “these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character”92. The Kingdom considers these principles, furthermore, to be a peremptory norm of general international law, and would like to refer in this respect to the conclusion of the International Law Commission to include “the basic rules of international humanitarian law” in its list of rules of jus cogens93. /n/nAs noted before, no sovereignty can be established over occupied territory  and occupied territory may not be annexed. In this regard, an important provision under the law of occupation is that the occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies102. Under international criminal law, such transfers, directly or indirectly, by the occupying Power, constitute a war crime, as reflected in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court103. It is also prohibited to deport protected persons from the occupied territory104. /n/nCertain rules of international human rights law can moreover be characterized as peremptory norms of international law. According to the International Law Commission, this includes the prohibition of genocide113, the prohibition of torture114, the prohibition of slavery, and the prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid, as well as the right of self-determination115."

The occupying Power has to respect and protect the civilians in the occupied territory, who are regarded as protected persons100.

At the same time, such measures of control and security may be taken by the occupying Power in regard to protected persons as may be necessary as a result of the war101. /n/nIt follows that an occupying power, for the purposes of international humanitarian law, is bound to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all those within the occupied territory. /n/nAs a final observation, it may be recalled that the Kingdom considers that all peremptory norms are applicable erga omnes. Therefore, the procedural legal consequence of a serious breach thereof is that all States, and international organizations, have legal standing to invoke responsibility for such a breach: they may claim cessation of continuing internationally wrongful acts, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, and performance of the obligation of reparation.

In the same month, the ancient Qibli Mosque was subject to a similar attack and significant damage was caused to historic glass windows, the minbar and the carpet114. /n/nOn 13 December 2021 and on 31 March 2023, the Patriarchs and the Heads of Churches of Jerusalem issued a statement expressing their concern that Christians and their holy sites have become the target of frequent and sustained attacks by Jewish radical groups, “with the aim of diminishing Christian presence”115. /n/nMr. President, Members of the Court, Israeli violations in the Muslim and Christian holy sites violate the rules of international law, including Articles 27 and 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as we have stated in depth in our Written Statement116. /n/nFurthermore, Israeli violations of the historic status quo at the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem threaten their integrity. They inflame global religious tension and create confrontations along religious lines. /n/nMy second point concerns the right to self-determination. This right is well established in customary international law and is a norm of jus cogens120, from which there can be no derogation. It goes hand in hand with the obligation to respect the territorial integrity of the self-determination unit121, as well as the right to permanent sovereignty over natural resources122. /n/nRegrettably, Israel’s occupation has now lasted for well over half a century. During this period, Israel has intentionally breached fundamental principles of the law of occupation; the raison d’être of these breaches is to deny the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. /n/nThe Occupied Palestinian Territory has been progressively fragmented. Its demographic composition has been and continues to be altered. Settlements and “outposts” expand rapidly, while the Palestinian people’s access to natural resources is denied and water resources are depleted124. /n/nAll this, Mr. President, Members of the Court, severely violates the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, including their right to an independent State on the 4 June 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The only way, Mr. President, for the right to self-determination to be exercised is for the occupation to come to an end. /n/nTurning to my third point, Israel’s policies and practices also violate the law of occupation, which applies throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel has engaged in a policy of progressively establishing settlements and so-called “outposts”. Israel’s 2018 Basic Law declares: “[t]he State views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value, and shall act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation”125. As others have said, 2023 was a record year for settlement expansion. And just recently, in late January, senior Israeli officials called for resettlement of Gaza and for the expanding settlement in the West Bank126. /n/nIsrael’s settlements have created a patchwork of territorial units throughout the West Bank; they seek to create facts on the ground and they undermine the establishment of a sovereign, independent, contiguous and viable Palestinian State. As many others have said, they are often accompanied by brutal settler violence, tolerated or even supported by the Israeli authorities; one effect is to instil a sense of terror and fear in Palestinians, leading to displacement from their own land127. /n/nThis brings me to the fourth point: Israel’s policies and practices, when considered in their entirety, leave no doubt as to Israel’s intention to annex the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nThe facts speak for themselves: Israel’s 1980 Basic Law, which purported to annex Jerusalem de jure; the continued construction of the wall in the West Bank despite the Court’s 2004 Opinion; the scale, infrastructure and location of Israeli settlements; the expansion of Israel’s direct civilian legal authority across the West Bank; and the continued displacement of Palestinians and the difficulties they face to return to their homes128. If there were any doubt, the map shown by the Prime Minister of Israel before the General Assembly last September129, which you have seen earlier this week, and his rejection of the two-State solution130 confirm Israel’s intention to annex. /n/nThe annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is a serious breach of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force — a peremptory norm of general international law. /n/nMr. President, my fifth point is that Israel’s discriminatory laws and practices severely affect the lives of Palestinians and demonstrate a total disregard for the occupying Power’s duty to protect the rights and well-being of the Palestinian people131. /n/nSpecifically, the policy of discrimination constitutes a serious violation of treaty obligations and of customary international law, tantamount to apartheid. The CERD Committee, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have each urged Israel to amend the 2018 “Basic Law” so as to eliminate its discriminatory effects and to ensure equal treatment of all persons within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction132. This has not been done. /n/nDiscriminatory expropriation laws have been supplemented by a vast catalogue of military orders that have little or nothing to do with security or public order. Instead, they permit discriminatory treatment in practically every aspect of daily life — a discriminatory planning régime in which permits are routinely denied to Palestinians; the discriminatory practice of demolitions; and the use of zoning to designate military areas or so-called “nature reserves”, access to which is either denied to Palestinians or subject to Israeli permission133. /n/n All of this is backed up by increasingly frequent interventions by Israeli armed forces to suppress protests, often with lethal fire; by the apparent impunity of those who engage in violence against Palestinians; by the use of excessive force; by attacks on health services; and by the ever-increasing arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of Palestinians, including children134. /n/nFurther, as explained in our written pleadings135, Israel has engaged in acts that constitute crimes against humanity and has failed to prevent and punish such crimes."

        "texto": "Now, in the following oral submissions, Japan wishes to focus exclusively on the issues relating to the acquisition of territory by force in so far as they are relevant to the questions put to the Court by the General Assembly. Japan considers that the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force is an essential element of the rule of law among nations to which Japan is profoundly attached, and of particular importance to the peace and stability in the region and the international community. Japan believes that this prohibition provides an important safeguard for the international community against the return of rule by force. /n/nUnited Nations General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), which is commonly called “the Friendly Relations Declaration”, states that “[n]o territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”. The Court clarified in the Wall Advisory Opinion that the illegality of the acquisition of territory by force is a corollary of the prohibition of use of force incorporated in the Charter of the United Nations. In the same vein, on 18 April 2023, G7 Foreign Ministers, under the Japanese presidency, reaffirmed this prohibition. The relevant paragraph of the Communiqué stated: “The prohibition on the acquisition of territory resulting from the threat or use of force, reaffirmed in the Friendly Relations Declaration of 1970, should be observed in good faith.”79 /n/nMr President, let me begin with the first point that Japan wishes to make. The prohibition of territorial acquisition by force does not apply only to territory of States within settled or internationally recognized borders. Even in the cases of territory where internationally recognized borders do not exist, that prohibition extends to territory that is under the peaceful administration and could also apply to uses of force across international lines of demarcation. /n/nThe paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration relating to the principle of non- acquisition of territory by force states that “the territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State”. It is not surprising to find the focus on attempts by States to acquire territory of another State. As an example, in October 2022, the United Nations General Assembly condemned the attempted illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine80. In that situation, the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force clearly applies to those territories as they are within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. /n/nHowever, the Friendly Relations Declaration seems to go further than acknowledging the prohibition of the acquisition of the territories within the internationally recognized borders of States by force. In the same paragraph, it proclaims that “[n]o territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”, without reference to “the territory of a State”. /n/nJapan takes the position that where sovereignty over a territory is not internationally recognized, but where the territory is under peaceful administration by a State that has not itself occupied the territory by force, the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force applies also. This principle follows from the reasoning adopted in the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission81. As this Court has recognized in the Wall Advisory Opinion, the prohibition of territorial acquisition by force follows from the prohibition of force. Therefore, the scope of the prohibition should be determined with reference to the interpretation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter. The Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission found that Eritrea violated Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter by attacking and occupying in 1998 the town of Badme, which the Commission found was under “peaceful administration” by Ethiopia at the time. In this regard, the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Communiqué in April 2023 also stated: “We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the peacefully established status of territories by force or coercion anywhere in the world.” /n/nFurthermore, the Friendly Relations Declaration states that “[e]very State likewise has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate international lines of demarcation, such as armistice lines, established by or pursuant to an international agreement to which it is a party or which it is otherwise bound to respect”. This declaration indicates that the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force could also apply to a territory where internationally recognized borders do not exist but where parties are bound to respect certain international lines of demarcation. /n/nMr President, the acquisition of territory by force consists of two elements, namely (i) the establishment of control over the territory through forcible measures and (ii) the intention to appropriate that territory permanently82. By “acquisition” or indeed “annexation” of territory by force, we mean a situation where a State attempts to acquire territorial title on the basis of forcible acts and where the State does not otherwise have valid title to that territory. /n/nThe clearest case of annexation is an attempt to annex occupied territory de jure. In such a circumstance, the occupying State formally declares its sovereignty over the annexed territory. /n/nHowever, in the Wall Advisory Opinion, this Court indicated that annexation could also take place de facto where the actions of a State lead to what the Court called a “fait accompli”, that is, a situation on the ground which becomes permanent and which others are compelled to accept83. A State seeking to avoid the denunciation of the international community may be incentivized to refrain from formally declaring the annexation of territory. Without clearly expressing its intention to annex the territory, it may seek to gain permanent control over a territory it occupies by engaging in military operations and taking a series of measures that make it materially impossible for other claimants to restore the status quo ante without risking death, physical injury or damage to property. In other words, the occupying State may create what you called a “fait accompli” through these measures. /n/nThe effect of the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force would be seriously undermined if States were allowed to circumvent the prohibition by simply obfuscating their true intentions to annex a territory and coercing other claimants to accept its permanent control over the territory through measures that create a “fait accompli”. It is therefore important to clarify in what circumstances such measures would constitute de facto annexation and amount to an unlawful attempt to acquire territory by force. /n/nIn the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court considered that Israel’s construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as the creation of an administrative régime facilitating the establishment of settlements of Israeli citizens in areas lying between the Green Line and the wall are the types of actions which would be tantamount to de facto annexation if it created a “fait accompli” that had effectively become permanent84. /n/nJapan considers that certain acts which have continuous coercive effect in imposing control over territory may create a “fait accompli” and are likely to indicate intention to maintain permanent control over the territory. The following acts by occupying States may have such continuous coercive effects: /n/nFirst, large-scale alteration of the demographic composition of the territory, backed by military and other physical power, including through expropriation of land and eviction of the population. /n/nSecond, the construction and continued maintenance by an occupying Power of a network of physical infrastructure, particularly where these represent such significant financial investment that they may be deemed to be intended to subsist over a significant period of time. This may include, for example, roads, communication systems, healthcare facilities or large-scale military or law enforcement facilities. /n/nThird, the continuous forcible seizure and exploitation of the natural resources, including water, by an occupying Power. /n/nThese acts do not necessarily cause death, injury or destruction, but when they are implemented cumulatively at a significant scale and sustained for a long period, they would have continuous, even irreversible, effect on the territory. In such a case there may be evidence that the occupying State’s intention is to permanently establish sovereignty over the relevant area, even if it is doing so incrementally. If such acts are accompanied by statements of State officials affirming the irreversibility of measures or even asserting the intent to establish sovereignty over the occupied territories, the measures I have just mentioned above are even more likely to indicate intention to acquire territory and thus amount to a prohibited attempt to acquire territory by force. /n/nThe key question here is whether a State that does not otherwise have valid title to territory can acquire title through a use of force because the State claims to be acting in self-defence. Japan rejects this argument. Two alternative but interlinked arguments support this position. The first is that the principle prohibiting acquisition of territory by force precludes any acquisition of territorial title through force, regardless of whether that force is unlawful or permitted as an exercise of self-defence. Alternatively, and in any event, uses of force resulting in the annexation of territory will never be lawful as exercises of self-defence since permanent annexation can never be a proportionate response to an armed attack. /n/nI begin by outlining the first argument. Japan submits that the principle prohibiting forcible acquisition of territory is properly understood as providing that the use of force is never a valid basis for acquiring title, even if the initial use of force by the State could have been lawful85. /n/nThis blanket prohibition is a necessary consequence of the complete abolition of the right of territorial conquest in the context of the United Nations Charter. In the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court described the principle on the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the use of force as the “corollary” of the prohibition against the use of force itself86. It is also connected to other fundamental principles of international law, in particular the right to self-determination of peoples as set out in the Friendly Relations Declaration87 and recognized by this Court88. It accordingly reflects a fundamental shift in international law in the twentieth century, particularly after the entry into force of the United Nations Charter, which sought to minimize unilateral recourse to force in international relations. /n/nThe prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on acquiring territory by force form part of a coherent scheme with the right to self-defence. The right to self-defence provides for States to have recourse to force in order to defend their people and to preserve territory they already have. It does not allow a right to use force to gain additional territorial title89. /n/nI would also like to highlight that a finding by the Court that conquest could confer title upon a State where force was used in self-defence would, in practice, be liable to widespread abuse90. The proper scope of self-defence in international law is controversial. States frequently make contested claims that some use of force or another is lawful as an exercise of self-defence. States seeking to acquire territory by force could accordingly seek to exploit this ambiguity. This would threaten to undermine the principle and, alongside it, the prohibition on the use of force. /n/nJapan’s view on the proper scope of the principle is supported by the General Assembly’s Friendly Relations Declaration, which states and I quote, again, because you’ve heard it many times: “The territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force . . . No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.”91 /n/nThis part of the declaration contains no exception for force used in self-defence and does not limit the principle prohibiting territorial acquisition by force to unlawful uses of force. By contrast, in the sentence immediately prior to the one that I have just quoted, the declaration prohibits “military occupation resulting from the use of force in contravention of the provisions of the Charter”92, indicating that where the use of force is not prohibited by the Charter, military occupation may be lawful93. /n/nThis conclusion  conclusion that the declaration endorses a blanket prohibition on acquisition of territory by force  is not affected by the declaration’s subsequent reaffirmation that it “shall [not] be construed as affecting” provisions of the Charter. The right of self-defence regulates the permissibility of uses of force in response to an armed attack, rather than dealing with the question of whether States can, through such use of force, acquire title to territory. The Friendly Relations Declaration accordingly clarifies that the answer to the latter question is “no” without purporting to affect the scope of self-defence as a justification for the use of force. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, let me turn to the alternative point with regard to the relationship between the prohibition of territorial acquisition by force and the right of self-defence  and this is my final point: annexation of territory can never meet the narrowly drawn requirements of the right of self-defence. /n/nAs the Court has repeatedly pointed out, any purported exercise of the right to self-defence must be necessary and proportionate94. Self-defence, by definition, can only justify the taking of temporary measures in order to achieve its aims. The aim of self-defence is limited to defending the attacked State and its people. Thus, even when a State has suffered an armed attack, it can never be proportionate to permanently deprive a people of its territory95. /n/nIn this regard, it is worth recalling that the acquisition of territory by force has been rejected in the context of States claiming to act in self-defence. The Security Council’s response to Iraq’s invasion and purported annexation of Kuwait in 1991 is worth noting. While demanding that Iraq “rescind immediately its actions”, the Security Council, in its resolution 686, simultaneously affirmed “the commitment of all Member States to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and Kuwait”96. It is thus clear that the territory of Iraq had not become liable to annexation even if States were to act in defence of Kuwait97. Another relevant example is, of course, Security Council resolution 242, which emphasized “the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” without drawing any distinction between lawful and unlawful uses of force98."

However, in our view, the issue of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is directly of concern to the United Nations itself and it goes much further than a mere bilateral dispute. As this Court noted in its Advisory Opinion on the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, even where a request for an advisory opinion relates to a legal question actually pending between States, its opinion is given not to the States but to the organ requesting it, in this case the General Assembly. /n/nIt has also been suggested that this Court ought not to opine because the questions are one- sided in nature.

        "texto": "Mr President, Israel has been in occupation of the Palestinian Territory since 1967. Accordingly, in that territory, it is obliged to respect applicable international humanitarian law, including the law of military occupation, and international human rights law. /n/nThe defining feature of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, has been continuous settlement activity. In our Written Statement, we have drawn on the authoritative reports of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to set out the numerous different ways in which this has occurred. But in summary, we say the following: /n/nIsrael has used different means to take and exercise control for non-military purposes over as much land in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as possible. /n/nOnce in control, Israel has undertaken permanent construction on this land, in particular developing or encouraging the development of permanent settlements, onto which it has incentivized large numbers of its own citizens to transfer. /n/nThrough its actions, Israel has fundamentally altered the demographics of the West Bank. As of 2022, almost 700,000 Israeli citizens were living in settlements in the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem. /n/nIsrael has extended the application of domestic Israeli law to those living in settlements, blurring the distinction between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory /n/nIsrael has transferred the exercise of authority in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in certain areas from military command to civilian control, integrating administration of the territory into that of Israel. /n/nBy transferring parts of its own civilian population into the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel has violated Article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It has continued to do this notwithstanding the Court’s confirmation of its unlawfulness in the Wall case and despite being exhorted by both the Security Council and the General Assembly to cease this practice. /n/nIsrael has also continued to unlawfully destroy and appropriate property throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory as part of its policy of encouraging and facilitating the expansion of settlements. This destruction and appropriation of property cannot reasonably be justified by military necessity. Rather, it is clear that it has been done to facilitate and indeed encourage the expansion of settlements. Such destruction and appropriation of property clearly breaches the Fourth Geneva Convention and the laws and customs of war codified by the 1907 Hague Regulations. /n/nThere has also been a recent, marked increase in reports of Palestinian civilians being subjected to sustained, serious violence by Israeli settlers, with little or no protection from the Israeli security forces, contrary to international humanitarian law. The security forces have been reported, and recorded, not only watching this violence without intervening, but in some instances, even participating in it themselves. This has escalated since 7 October and the Secretary-General has warned that tensions have now reached “boiling point”. /n/nThe Secretary-General and High Commissioner have expressed concern that this violence, particularly when considered in light of the appropriation and destruction of Palestinian property, has compelled Palestinians to leave their homes, their farms and their grazing grounds. The Secretary-General has noted that the coercive environment created by Israel could amount to forcible transfer, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention which may amount to a war crime. /n/nThe evident permanence of the settlements can only be explained, in Ireland’s assessment, by Israel’s intention of annexing the land upon which they are built. In our view, the development and expansion of settlements clearly demonstrate that Israel is and has been engaged in a process of annexation of that land for decades. The absence of any declaration of annexation or formal de jure act of incorporation over most of the West Bank is immaterial. Despite references in the current Israeli Government’s coalition agreements, which the Secretary-General describes as promoting a policy of “application of sovereignty” over the West Bank, previous history suggests that no announcement or formal act of incorporation may occur in the near future. /n/nNevertheless, in Ireland’s view, Israel is already engaged in the process of annexing Palestinian territory. It is doing so de facto, through its policy of encouraging demographic change in that territory by population transfer and by the continuous development and maintenance of permanent settlements and infrastructure. Ireland is concerned that it may also be doing so de jure, by increasingly extending the application of domestic Israeli law and civilian administration to the settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, thereby integrating them into its own territory and erasing the differences in law between Israel and the settlements. /n/nBut whether de facto, de jure or both, this process of annexation is in clear breach of the prohibition in international law against the acquisition of territory by threat or use of force, a fundamental principle of international law. To assert that this is not the case simply because Israel has not formally declared annexation would render the prohibition devoid of all meaning. That would permit States to acquire territory by force, without legal consequence, simply by declining to adopt a formal act of annexation or incorporation. /n/nInternational humanitarian law does not classify a military occupation as either lawful or unlawful per se rather it recognizes that military occupation may occur during the course of an armed conflict and it sets down rules to regulate the conduct of the occupying Power, in particular its armed forces. Military occupation is necessarily temporary in so far as international law prohibits the acquisition of territory by force. Occupation does not confer sovereignty rather, it is a temporary exception to sovereignty and, accordingly, it cannot be of indefinite duration. /n/nProlonged occupation over an extended period of time therefore unavoidably raises legal questions, in particular whether it constitutes a disguised form of annexation and/or a determined effort to deny the people of an occupied territory the exercise of their right to self-determination. In either case, the legality of the occupying Power’s presence in the territory inevitably arises. While it is of course possible that a military occupation effected by force may be undertaken in exercise of the right in international law to the use of force in self-defence, any such occupation may involve no more and may endure no longer than is necessary and proportionate to the armed attack to which it is a response. /n/nIn the case of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel’s military occupation commenced in 1967 and has continued now, uninterrupted, for some 57 years. It has also entailed, as I have said, extensive and continuous, permanent and deliberate settlement building. Neither the duration of the occupation nor the scale and extent of settlement activity is, in Ireland’s view, justified or permitted by the law regulating the use of force in self-defence. Indeed, if the security of one people can only be achieved by the occupation over so many decades of the territory of another people, one has to wonder whether there can be any military solution to the problem that it purports to address. In our view, the only effective solution to the problem can be a political one. /n/nMr President, I wish to turn now to the question of self-determination. As submitted in our Written Statement, Ireland has concluded that by its prolonged occupation of Palestinian lands and continuous settlement activity on those lands, Israel has prevented the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination. The principle of self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the two 1966 International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The content of that principle was elaborated in the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations, adopted by consensus at the General Assembly. That declaration makes clear that “Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples bearing in mind that subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a violation of the principle, as well as a denial of fundamental human rights, and is contrary to the Charter”. /n/nIn the Wall case, the Court found that the construction of the wall and its associated régime severely impeded the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination. It therefore breached Israel’s obligation to respect that right. In Ireland’s view, the combination of Israel’s prolonged occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and its escalating settlement activity has done so on a far greater scale. That escalating activity has increasingly fragmented Palestinian presence upon and restricted Palestinian use of the land and the natural resources of the Palestinian people. It threatens the viability of a future Palestinian State. The nature, scale and duration of settlement activity is such that its purpose can only be to permanently obstruct the exercise of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. /n/nIreland has, with regret, concluded that by its prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory and the settlement activities it has conducted there for more than half a century, Israel has committed serious breaches of a number of peremptory norms of general international law and the corresponding erga omnes obligations to which they give rise, namely: /n/nthe basic rules of international humanitarian law; the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; and the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force."

In turn, peremptory norms of general international law give right to obligations owed to the international community as a whole (obligations erga omnes), in relation to which all States have a legal interest, a conclusion also recently reached by the International Law Commission. /n/nFor all States, as members of the international community as a whole to which the relevant obligations erga omnes are owed, the legal consequences of these serious breaches are, in Ireland’s view, straightforward. All States are obliged to co-operate to bring these breaches to an end through lawful means, not to recognize as lawful the situation created by them and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation. /n/nIn particular, States are obliged to co-operate to bring to an end Israel’s serious breach of its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination or, as the Court found in the Wall case, to see to it that any impediment to the exercise of that right is brought to an end. This includes co-operation by States through the United Nations and, as appropriate, other international organizations, including the European Union. /n/nAs regards the obligation not to recognize as lawful the situation created by these serious breaches, the Court has provided an example of how this may be achieved in its Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia. There, the Court found that the duty of non-recognition obliged States, inter alia, “to abstain from entering into economic and other forms of relationship or dealings with South Africa which may entrench its authority over the territory of Namibia”. /n/nIn the present case, we say that States are obliged not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s breach of its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.

It requires them to take steps to prevent trade that assists in the maintenance of the situation created by the settlement activity, or that implicitly recognizes or serves to entrench or legitimize Israel’s settlement or annexation of that territory."

Therefore, we call for and emphasize the necessity of compliance with the rules of international law and the decisions issued by your esteemed Court. We specifically refer to the Advisory Opinion issued by your esteemed Court regarding the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian territories in the year 2004. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the Israeli occupying entity commits many violations and breaches of the principles of international law, and the international community has documented these violations, including those substantiated in reports by the Secretary-General of the United Nations submitted to the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council. These reports focus on investigating Israeli practices that impact the human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab inhabitants in the occupied territories, examining the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. /n/nThe Israeli occupying entity adopts multiple practices that rise to the level of genocide, referring specifically to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948, in particular, under Article II of the convention, which defines acts classified as genocide, the killing practices that have targeted civilians in residential areas, hospitals, schools and refugee shelters in Palestine in general, and in the Gaza Strip in particular, fall under the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that Article. Additionally, the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949, under Articles 146, 147 and 148, stipulates the imposition of criminal sanctions on parties to the convention in case of non-compliance with its provisions. /n/nThe oppressive practices affecting the city of Al-Quds, the capital of the Palestinian State, as well as the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, as the occupying entity attempts to impose a demographic reality aimed at a subsequent stage, which involves emptying the city of its original inhabitants and settling extremists and racists in it. This constitutes a violation of numerous resolutions, the latest being the United Nations General Assembly decision adopted on 21 December 2017. This decision came after a series of resolutions emphasizing the necessity of not to prejudice the demographic character of the Holy City of Al-Quds. /n/nImposing a suffocating economic blockade on all industrial, agricultural and commercial activities is evident in campaigns of land confiscation and seizure of homes and private property, supported by an official policy aimed at displacing the indigenous Palestinian population from their lands and demolishing their homes. These practices fall within the scope of crimes that amount to the destruction of an entire people. These actions have been documented by multiple reports, including those of the Secretary-General, the Human Rights Council and international organizations, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). /n/nThe continuous aggression on the Gaza Strip and the imposition of a land, sea and air blockade, along with a series of decisions, policies and procedures that target civilians, with the aim of changing the demographic reality on the ground, represent a flagrant violation of international law and human rights principles. The occupying entity has undertaken systematic measures, including mass arrests, demolition of homes, killing civilians, children, women, and the elderly. The right of the Palestinian people to their land has been subjected to a policy of deprivation and subjugation by force."

        "texto": "first, according to the United Nations Secretary-General, as a result of Israeli military operations, the entire population is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history and 2.2 million Palestinians there are struggling to simply make it through another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food and drinking water; second, according to the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, “for children in particular, there is no food, no water, no school; nothing but the terrifying sounds of war, day in and day out, and its people are witnessing daily threats to their very existence — while the world watches on”; and third, according to the WHO, the population in Gaza is facing extreme hunger, with insufficient food and high levels of malnutrition. Yet, the conditions in Gaza are becoming much worse every day. /n/nMr President, now I turn to the first section of our reasoning regarding the merits of the matter; here, we first argue that the Israeli occupying régime has violated, and continues to violate, on several grounds, the Palestinians’ right to self-determination. /n/nThe legal status of the right to self-determination is generally understood to be attributed to “peoples” and grounded first in the United Nations Charter, in several United Nations General Assembly resolutions and its inclusion in common Article 1 of the two International Covenants of Human Rights. As such, “all peoples have the right freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and their place in the international community and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development, and every State has the duty to respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter”. /n/nFirst and foremost, the prolonged occupation by the Israeli occupying régime confirms its intention to make it permanent, in violation of the principle of prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force. /n/nThe occupation of the Palestinian territories is the longest military occupation existing today. The right to self-determination of the Palestinian people continues to be violated as long as this occupation ages; this ongoing violation thwarts the Palestinians’ ability to rely on State-based rights and obligations under international law, depriving them of their inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to live in freedom, justice and dignity. /n/nThus, we request the Court to consider the very fact of prolongation of the occupation as an indicator of the violation of the right of Palestinians to self-determination. /n/nMr President, apart from prolonged occupation, altering the demographic composition in the occupied territories has led to violation of the Palestinians’ right to self-determination. The United Nations Security Council has a bulk of resolutions concerning the occupation of Palestinian territories, all condemning, among others, altering the demographic composition of these territories by the Israeli occupying Power. Hence, it is a well-established fact that the Israeli occupying régime has grossly violated international law on an ongoing basis. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention reads: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” Apart from that, the Court, in its opinion in the Wall case declared that: “[the] provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory”. /n/nFurthermore, the Court affirmed, in the same case, the violation of the right to self-determination based on measures taken by the occupying Power which has led to a change in the demographic composition of Palestine. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, forcible deportation of civilian populations, widely known for one of its most infamous instances as “Nakba Day”, has a long history. Essentially, with the illegal formation of the Israeli occupying régime in 1948 instead of the former British Mandate of Palestine, the demographic composition changed significantly with the displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinians. In fact, the Israeli occupying régime was illegally established that year through a violent, arbitrary process and involved the deportation or forcible transfer of hundreds of thousands of native Palestinians from their land to create a majority Jewish colony, in line with the demands of the Zionist movement. /n/nBy denying the right to return of forcibly deported Palestinians to Palestine, the Israeli régime continues to deprive those Palestinians of their right to live in their homeland. The majority of Palestinians live outside Palestine mainly in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, with many of them remaining stateless, living in crowded refugee camps that lack basic infrastructure. /n/nNeedless to say, forcible displacement of civilian population is of such a high significance that it has been defined as a war crime under Article 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. /n/nMr President, the next measure that has violated the right of self-determination of Palestinians, is altering the character and status of the Holy City of Al-Quds. The actions taken by the Israeli occupying régime with regard to the Holy City of Al-Quds have utterly disregarded the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. /n/nAltering the character and status of Al-Quds has had significant religious and cultural implications for the Palestinian people. Al-Quds Al-Sharif has a remarkable religious and historical significance for Palestinians, as well as for Muslims, Christians and Jews worldwide. By altering the status quo of the City and its holy sites, the Israeli occupying régime has undermined the cultural heritage and identity of the Palestinian people and has further violated their right to self-determination. /n/nThe construction and expansion of the settlements, along with the violation of Palestinians’ right to free movement and the revocation of residency permits, have altered the demographic and cultural character of the City as well. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the next series of measures depriving the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination comprise of discriminatory measures targeting the basic rights of the people in the occupied territories. This has been underlined by the United Nations General Assembly and recorded extensively to include the killing and injury of civilians, the forced displacement of civilians and a systematic policy of obstruction of humanitarian assistance. /n/nThe Israeli occupying régime’s action, as manifested in various laws and policies, has created a system of discrimination that has negatively affected the Palestinian population. In Palestine, the occupying régime’s expansionism has consolidated into apartheid through the longest occupation in modern history. It is well established that apartheid is a crime against conscience and dignity of mankind, and is further in violation of fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the United Nations Charter and crystalized in international human rights law, and seriously threatens international peace and security. /n/nThe Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Palestine has concluded that the political system of entrenched rule in occupied Palestine, which endows one racial-national-ethnic group with substantial rights, benefits and privileges while intentionally subjecting another group to live behind walls and checkpoints under a permanent military rule, satisfies the prevailing evidentiary standard for the existence of apartheid. Many laws, policies and practices implemented since 1948 by the Israeli occupying régime have been aimed at fragmenting the Palestinian people and dividing them into various groups; this clearly denies the Palestinian people its right to self-determination. /n/nIn tandem with the above, construction and expansion of the settlements, segregated roads, barriers and checkpoints has created a system of apartheid, effectively isolating Palestinian communities, which manifestly violates multiple provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. /n/nThe Court is, therefore, requested to opine that such policies and practices must be ceased immediately as they continue to violate the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the right to exercise permanent sovereignty over natural resources is an inevitable component of the right to self-determination. The two international covenants of human rights and a number of United Nations General Assembly resolutions recognize this right. The United Nations General Assembly has expressed grave concern over a range of practices by the Israeli occupying régime negatively impacting Palestinians’ natural resources. /n/nIt has been affirmed that the right of the Palestinian people to permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources is an integral component of the right to self-determination. It has been further confirmed that the right should be used in the interest of their national development, the well-being of the Palestinian people and as part of their right to self-determination. /n/nYet, Palestinians do not enjoy their own natural resources, which include land, fresh water and mineral resources. Imposing restrictions, by the Israeli régime, on access of Palestinians to water resources, groundwater and hydrocarbon deposits are all instances of flagrant violation of the right to self-determination."

In this context, an “interested” or “third” State, in accordance with the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, could be defined as one which is not directly affected or injured by an internationally wrongful act, and which has yet a legal interest in the protection and compliance of the rights by the very reason “of the importance of the rights involved . . . and their very nature” which makes them “the concern of all States”. /n/nAs regards the primary obligations of third States towards prolonged occupation of Palestine, the three obligations mentioned above remain relevant in accordance with paragraph 146 of the 2004 Advisory Opinion in the Wall case. /n/nIn addition to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, the primary triple obligations of third States towards serious breaches of erga omnes obligations find support in the practice of other United Nations organs as well. In its resolution 2334, the United Nations Security Council unequivocally reiterated the importance of States abstaining from recognizing the occupying Power’s internationally wrongful acts. /n/nThe International Law Commission, in Draft Article 41 (1) of its 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, along with underlining the duty of a State to not recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach of erga omnes rules, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation, emphasized the duty of all States to co-operate through lawful means, in a joint and co-ordinated effort, to counteract the effects of these breaches. /n/nFirst, not to aid or assist, directly or indirectly, the Israeli occupying régime enabling it to continue its prolonged occupation of Palestine and/or any of its continued policies and practices that violate the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; this may include in particular avoiding any kind of political, military, economic or other co-operation with the Israeli régime enabling it to continue such violations. Second, not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from prolonged occupation, by the Israeli occupying régime, of Palestinian territory and/or any of its continued measures that violate the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; and Third, to co-operate effectively with one another in all relevant fields and forums to bring to an end any impediment resulting from the ongoing violation by the Israeli occupying régime of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including from its prolonged occupation, and any of its measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Al-Quds; obviously, such co-operation is of utmost urgency and importance given the ongoing situation in the Gaza Strip, where, according to one estimate, Israel’s military is killing Palestinians at an average rate of 250 people a day, which exceeds the daily death toll of any other major conflict of recent years. /n/nIn this context, I recall this honourable Court’s important Order of 26 January 2024 on the request by South Africa for the indication of provisional measures. The Order concerns the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and, as such, all States, in particular those providing support to Israel, are legally under the duty to prevent genocide, particularly by ceasing to provide any aid to the genocider. They are under a duty to punish perpetrators of the crime of genocide. Given the current extremely tragic conditions in the Gaza Strip, the Court is respectfully requested to, once again, call on the occupying régime to fully comply with the Order. Evidently, in practical terms, even the partial compliance of the Israeli régime with only subparagraph 1 of paragraph 86 of that Order is possible only through complete termination of all its military operations in the Gaza Strip."

Furthermore, the advisory opinion will offer clearer legal guidance on the legal issues involved in the negotiations, thus facilitating the relaunching of the negotiation process. /n/nChina supports the Court in discharging its jurisdiction in accordance with the law, with a focus on identifying, interpreting and applying existing rules, upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, providing legal guidance to the UN in dealing with the question of Palestine, and fostering a proper settlement through peace talks."

        "texto": "The Palestinian-Israeli conflict stems from Israel’s prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory and Israel’s long-standing oppression of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people fight against Israeli oppression and their struggle for completing the establishment of an independent State on the occupied territories are, essentially, just actions for restoring their legitimate rights. The right to self-determination serves as the precise legal foundation for their struggle. /n/nThe Palestinian people, being a group residing in territory under foreign domination2, is a sui generis international legal person as a whole3. The right to self-determination of the Palestinian people has been consistently reaffirmed in multiple United Nations resolutions4 and the Wall Advisory Opinion5. This is also widely recognized by most States and international organizations. /n/nEvery State is obliged to promote the realization of the right to self-determination and to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples of that right. In their pursuit of the right to self-determination, these peoples have the right to engage in struggles, seek and receive support11. On the basis of that right, the Palestinian people declared the establishment of the State of Palestine in 1988, which has been recognized by over 130 countries./n/nAgainst the backdrop of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, well-documented and widely recognized facts indicate that Israel’s oppressing policies and practices, throughout its prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory, have severely undermined and impeded the exercise and full realization of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. /n/nThe principle of non-use of force is at the core of jus ad bellum. As a corollary of this principle, the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force is firmly established in customary international law. Using force to occupy and maintain such occupation for the purposes of territorial acquisition or annexing an occupied territory by force in whole or in part, is each illegal. These are confirmed by the Friendly Relations Declaration of 1970, the “Definition of Aggression” of 1974 and the Wall Advisory Opinion15. /n/nIsrael’s occupation has been explicitly recognized as unlawful by several United Nations resolutions. Following Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967, the Security Council adopted resolution 242 that “[e]mphasiz[es] the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war”. Similarly, multiple General Assembly resolutions affirmed the illegality of Israel’s occupation16. /n/nObviously, the rules of belligerent occupation are applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory and should be followed by both parties to the conflict. Facts indicate that relevant Israeli policies and practices have violated international humanitarian law and international human rights law. /n/nChina is of the view that the temporary and non-sovereign nature of belligerent occupation means that an occupying Power cannot acquire sovereignty over the territory during the belligerency. Belligerent occupation, under any circumstances, does not have the effect of lawful annexation. The rules of acquisitive prescription in international law does not apply to belligerent occupation. Fifty- seven years have passed since Israel began its occupation of the Palestinian territory. Regardless of the duration of the occupation, the unlawful nature of the occupation and the sovereignty over the occupied territories remain unchanged."

First, the General Assembly is competent to request an advisory opinion, given that the United Nations has “a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy”. Second, the questions addressed to the Court are legal questions, “framed in terms of law and rais[ing] problems of international law”. The request that the Court determine the existence of violations of international law and their corresponding legal consequences is “by [its] very nature susceptible of a reply based on law”. /n/nMalaysia further submits that there are no compelling reasons preventing the Court from exercising its jurisdiction, which after all represents, in the Court’s own words “its participation in the activities of the United Nations”, which, “in principle, should not be refused”. /n/nMalaysia stresses, first and in principle, that questions of self-determination are never purely bilateral matters between States: they refer to a peremptory norm of international law, which produces erga omnes obligations, owed to the international community as a whole. That being so, all States and the United Nations have a legal interest in the protection of the rights involved. But quite apart from that, the questions before the Court are not at all concerned with settling disputes between Israel and Palestine. The Court is requested to set out the legal consequences of Israel’s “policies and practices” in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Its advisory opinion will inform the exercise by the General Assembly of the “permanent responsibility” of the United Nations towards the question of Palestine. Such matters neither involve the determination of “permanent status” issues, nor are they for the parties to any “direct dialogue” to waive or disregard. /n/nAs a final point, Malaysia recalls that it was on these grounds that the Court decided to exercise its advisory jurisdiction in the Wall, rejecting these and other arguments which have been replayed in these proceedings, such as that the Court does not have sufficient information and evidence. Malaysia submits that the Court was correct then and that there are no more compelling reasons today for the Court to refuse to render the opinion requested than there were 20 years ago."

        "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
        "texto": "Malaysia’s submission today is straightforward. The “policies and practices” of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are a set of acts and measures that individually breach a number of rules of public international law. These “policies and practices”, however, taken together, also amount to a serious breach of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, which is protected by peremptory norm of international law. The occupation of Palestine, for its part, is nothing but these “policies and practices” itself. The occupation itself is thus in serious breach of peremptory norm of international law and must be brought to an end immediately. /n/nMalaysia submits that the “policies and practices” of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory consist of a set of acts and of legislative, administrative and other measures. These include: the construction, maintenance and extension of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; the establishment, maintenance, expansion and protection of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory along with their associated discriminatory legal régime; the demolition of Palestinians’ homes and of forced transfer of the Palestinians in that territory; the control and the provision of food, water, electricity and other amenities to the Occupied Palestinian Territory; and other acts and measures, detailed both by United Nations organs and by the States having chosen to appear before you. /n/nAll these “policies and practices” constitute in and of themselves violations of individual rules of international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of occupation, international human rights law, the prohibition of the use of force and the associated prohibition of acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force, and others. All of this is detailed in Malaysia’s Written Statement, as well as in other written statements submitted to the Court in these proceedings. And we have heard, over the last few days, many States argue before the Court along these lines. /n/nMalaysia submits that, taken together, these “policies and practices”, apart from breaching individual rules of international law, also constitute a serious breach of the Palestinian peoples’ right to self-determination, a jus cogens obligation incumbent on all States, and owed to the international community as a whole. /n/nMalaysia further submits that these “policies and practices” in and of themselves constitute the occupation of the Palestinian territory. These “policies and practices”, Mr President, are nothing but the means by which Israel is exercising its control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the means by which it is enforcing its occupation. These “policies and practices”, resulting as they do in a serious breach of the jus cogens right to self-determination, cannot but affect the legal status of the occupation of the Palestinian territory by Israel, rendering it unlawful. /n/nSecond, there can also be no doubt that the right to self-determination applies to the Palestinian people. As this Court noted in the Wall Advisory Opinion, “[a]s regards the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination, . . . the existence of a ‘Palestinian people’ is no longer in issue”. /n/nThe fourth submission that Malaysia wishes to make is that the “policies and practices” of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate numerous individual rules of international law, as well as each one of the four core, substantive elements of the right to self-determination. I will demonstrate this as briefly as possible, Mr President. /n/nIsrael’s “policies and practices” with respect to the legal status of East Jerusalem, along with its establishment, facilitation and expansion of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, with their associated infrastructure and discriminatory legal régime, amount to attempts at de jure and de facto annexation, respectively. This is in clear breach of the prohibition of acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force, a corollary of the prohibition of the use of force in the United Nations Charter, which is a peremptory norm of international law. Israel’s transfer of civilians into the Occupied Palestinian Territory is a breach of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and constitutes a war crime per the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Apart from constituting individual breaches of international law, these “policies and practices” violate the territorial integrity of the Palestinian people, and thus the right to self-determination. /n/nIsrael’s “policies and practices” which aim at changing the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, along with the creation of enclaves of Palestinians, the demolition of their homes, the limitation of their freedom of movement, including the blockade, siege and purported evacuation of the Gaza Strip, constitute violations of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law. But they also violate the unity and integrity of the Palestinian people, and thus its right to self-determination. /n/nIsrael’s “policies and practices” of expropriation of Palestinian land for use as settlements, of control over all water resources in the West Bank and control of water provision in the Gaza Strip, of granting licences for oil and gas extraction, and of operating quarries in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitute violations of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law. But they also violate the permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people over its natural wealth and resources. They thus violate its right to self-determination. /n/nIsrael’s “policies and practices” of exploitation of natural resources, of restrictive zoning and planning régimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, of blockading Gaza and subsequently razing it to the ground, of hampering and limiting access of Palestinians to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water, of preventing Palestinians from accessing sites of religious and cultural importance in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, of restricting their freedom of association and expression, and of condoning settler violence constitute violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. But they also violate the Palestinian people’s freedom to pursue their economic, social and cultural development, and thus its right to self-determination. /n/n“[A]long with measures taken previously”, the Court said. That was a reference, as is evident from the preceding paragraphs of the Advisory Opinion, to the “policies and practices” of Israel involving the establishment of settlements and their associated régime. If that was the case then, 20 years ago, a fortiori this must be the case now  how could it not be? If anything, Israel has maintained and extended the wall, and it has escalated the “measures taken previously”, ramping up the establishment of the settlements, expanding them, providing funding and amenities to them, as well as security, and extending the associated discriminatory legal régime. It has also continued and escalated the demolition of Palestinian homes, the practice of forced transfers and the transfers of its own civilians into the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nThe “a fortiori” argument I made with respect to the existence of a violation of the right to self-determination applies here as well: this is not just any violation, Mr President. It is a serious breach of a peremptory norm of international law. If it were so with respect to the much more limited issue before the Court in 2004, it must certainly be so today. We are no longer talking about the construction of a wall; we are talking about the whole host of “policies and practices” of the acts and measures so well documented by the United Nations and by most of the States that have spoken in these proceedings. These could not amount to anything less than what the construction of a wall amounted to 20 years ago. Indeed, they underscore the devastating deterioration of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since then. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, I will have to return to the legal consequences of Israel’s “policies and practices” in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in the final part of my presentation. But before I do so, I would like to conclude this part of the argument. I have established so far that Israel’s “policies and practices” in the OPT constitute not only violations of several rules of international law, but also violations of each core element of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. Malaysia submits that this serious breach of a most fundamental peremptory norm of international law renders unlawful the occupation as a whole. /n/nIn particular, Malaysia submits that it is the “policies and practices” discussed and assessed in these proceedings that constitute the occupation. These “policies and practices” are in fact the occupation itself. There are many means by which Israel enforces its control, the means by which it occupies the Palestinian territory. And they are also unlawful: they breach a great number of rules of international law and ultimately result in a serious breach of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. This must mean that the occupation as a whole is unlawful, as it constitutes a flagrant denial of the right to self-determination."

Reading the relevant paragraphs of the Court’s Opinion leaves no room for doubt in this respect. The Court called upon all States not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. The Court also found that “[i]t is . . . for all States . . . to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end”. This language closely reflects Article 41 of the Articles on State Responsibility regarding the particular consequences of serious breaches of obligations under peremptory norms of international law. /n/nIn particular, all States must co-operate to bring to an end through lawful means the serious breach of the right to self-determination and, consequently, the unlawful occupation of the Palestinian territory. Further, all States must not recognize as lawful the situation created by the serious breach of the right to self-determination, that is, the occupation of the Palestinian territory. Finally, all States must not render aid or assistance to Israel in maintaining the unlawful denial of the Palestinian’s right to self-determination, thus the occupation of the Palestinian territory.

        "texto": "It is, as you know, settled that the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War applies to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as noted by the Court in the Wall Opinion. In addition to that, the 1907 Hague Regulations “have become part of customary law” and therefore apply to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Despite the Israeli argument that the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court found as a matter of treaty law, that it does indeed apply, as it would to “any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties”. /n/nIn 2001, the Conference of High Contracting Parties “reaffirm[ed]” the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Al Quds, and called, inter alia, upon “the Occupying Power to immediately refrain from committing grave breaches involving any of the acts mentioned in art. 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, such as wilful killing, torture, unlawful deportation, wilful depriving of the rights of fair and regular trial, extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity”. /n/nA variety of international human rights treaties apply to these proceedings. Among the most important of these are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Both States, Palestine and the occupying force, are parties to these treaties. /n/nThe prohibition against the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and is an essential cornerstone of the international legal order. /n/nArticle 2 (4) provides: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” /n/nThe prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid is reflected most in CERD. As the Court has very recently underlined that 182 States are parties to CERD  a fact which confirms the universal character of the convention. Those parties include both the State of Palestine and the occupying force. /n/nIt is well established that the prohibition of racial discrimination forms part of customary law and has long been recognized as a peremptory norm. The Court in Barcelona Traction considered the prohibition of racial discrimination to be a norm of erga omnes character, stating that: /n/n“Such obligations derive, for example, in contemporary international law, from the outlawing of acts of aggression, and of genocide, as also from the principles and rules concerning the basic rights of the human person, including protection from slavery and racial discrimination.” /n/nThe right of self-determination exists in customary international law and is recognized by the United Nations Charter as well as in the ICCPR and ICESCR. /n/nIt must be also stated that the obligation to respect a people’s right of self-determination is a peremptory principle of general international law. As the Court noted in the East Timor case, the right to self-determination “is one of the essential principles of contemporary international law”, enjoying an erga omnes character. /n/nThe United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly confirmed the right of Palestinian people to self-determination, for example, resolution 2672 of 8 December 1970. It recognized “that the people of Palestine are entitled to equal rights and self-determination, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations” and that “full respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine is an indispensable element in the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, now we come to the illegality of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territory. The Israeli six-decade occupation of Palestinian territory is a continuing, gross and systematic breach of its legal obligations under the United Nations Charter and the general international law, also international humanitarian law, international human rights law and customary international law, including the violation of at least three peremptory norms of general international law of a jus cogens and erga omnes character. It shows that Israel has annexed and plans to continue to annex Jerusalem, Al-Quds, and the rest of the West Bank; that it has imposed systematic and comprehensive racial discrimination tantamount to apartheid against the Palestinian people based on their race; and that it has denied their right to self-determination in their own land. /n/nIn view of these policies and practices, Israel’s occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful, rendering Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory an internationally wrongful act as it seriously breaches at least three peremptory norms of general international law, derogation from which is not permitted. /n/nOn the matter of self-determination, Israel has not only denied the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, but actively tried to suppress and to extinguish it, even after the Court’s ruling in 2004 that Israel has an obligation erga omnes to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Israel has in fact escalated its policies and practices with the specific intention of permanently precluding the exercise of the right of Palestinian people including their right to independence in their State"

        "texto": "With your permission, I turn now to my first topic focusing on whether the Court has jurisdiction to render the advisory opinion requested. In Kuwait’s view, the answer is a categorical yes. Indeed, the majority of submissions in these proceedings argue in favour of the Court’s jurisdiction. Article 65 of the Statute of the Court provides that the Court may render an advisory opinion “on any legal question at the request of [any organ or institution] authorized by . . . the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request”. In turn, Article 96 of the United Nations Charter: “The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question”. In practice, it is primarily the General Assembly that has most frequently utilized this procedure to date. After all, when the General Assembly decides to request the Court to deliver an advisory opinion, this means that the request reflects an important concern of the international community, seeking a legal answer. The Court itself observed that the General Assembly, within the scope of its peacekeeping responsibilities, has a broader perspective than that of the Security Council, as it also considers humanitarian, social and economic aspects. /n/nAn attentive look at the Court’s jurisprudence points to the fact that “only ‘compelling reasons’ may lead the Court to refuse its opinion in response to a request falling within its jurisdiction”. Although the Court has the discretionary power to refuse to respond to a request for an advisory opinion for reasons of judicial propriety, it has not availed itself of this option thus far. /n/nIn the present case, it is incontestable that the questions included in the relevant General Assembly resolution are clearly specific questions of legal character. Any attempt to qualify them as non-specific or non-legal should fail. It is worth noting that the Court in the Wall Advisory Opinion rejected similar attempts. In essence, in the Wall Advisory Opinion, the central issue revolved around the construction of the wall and its impact on the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. Twenty years later, the context has broadened substantially. The Court is now tasked with determining the legal status of the ongoing occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 1967, given its persistence for over 57 years."

        "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
        "texto": "Regrettably, the above-mentioned foundational rules have not been upheld in the case of Palestine. The conflict between Palestine and Israel, hereafter referred to as the “occupying Power,” is an illegal occupation conflict, involving on one side an occupying Power equipped with all military means, and on the other side an occupied nation without defensive capabilities, facing daily expulsion, human rights violations and all sufferings associated with any occupation situation. /n/nOver the past decades, the situation between the Palestinians and the occupying Power has been extremely tense, resulting in serious human rights law and humanitarian law violations committed by the latter. Various intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations have documented these violations by publishing comprehensive reports. This climate of violence compromises any possibility of reasonably discussing the issues at stake. This is further exacerbated by the recent developments in Gaza. The occupying Power has waged an illegitimate war on the Palestinians in Gaza characterized by numerous international law violations. The ongoing flagrant violations have been highlighted in a series of statements issued, amongst others, by the United Nations Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council. /n/nIn the 1948 Nakba, 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced, and since then millions more. The situation has deteriorated exponentially since the illegal occupation started in 1967. The occupying Power has engaged in a forced displacement campaign against the Palestinians by demolishing their homes and confiscating their lands. Forced displacement violates international law. The occupying Power is under the obligation to ensure that its operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory comply with the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War to which it is a party. Article 49 of this convention clearly prohibits “forcible transfers, individual or mass... regardless of their motive,” which includes forced displacements as well as expulsions from the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Furthermore, Article 53 of the same instrument prohibits the destruction of property. Finally, under Article 147, illegal transfers, destruction, and appropriation of property carried out on a large scale is prohibited. /n/nAs Kuwait explained in its Written Submission, the occupying Power has also committed other grave violations of international law, including the policy of settling parts of its population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This unlawful policy has and continues to be deplorably promoted by the successive governments of the occupying Power. Since 1967, the occupying Power has embarked on an intensive campaign of colonization. Some settlements consisted of just a few prefabricated houses, while others expanded to become fully fledged small towns. In early 2023, there were around 730,000 Israeli settlers and over 280 Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including 230,000 settlers in East Jerusalem. These settlements are sustained by a network of military checkpoints and restricted zones, as well as Jewish-only roads and highways, all of which limit gravely the lives and livelihoods of Palestinians and violate their fundamental human rights. Both the construction of settlements and the transfer of settlers to the West Bank and Gaza are grave violations of international law, in particular Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which states that “the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. /n/nIt is also noteworthy, Mr President, that settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are not governed by the same laws that apply to the indigenous inhabitants of the territory. Jewish settlers are provided with special rights, facilities and subsidies that are denied to the indigenous Palestinian population. The occupying Power’s policy not only supports the existing settlers, but also incentivizes new settlers. The discriminatory policies and practices also violate the sovereignty of Palestinians over their natural resources — allowing the settlers and foreign companies to exploit the water and agricultural products of the occupied land without any benefit to the occupied population. It is widely recognized that the occupying Power has codified its discriminatory policies and practices against Palestinians in its legislation. Specifically, it grants rights to Israeli Jews and systematically discriminates against Palestinians. For instance, the Land Acquisition Law of 1953 facilitates the alienation of confiscated Palestinian land for the benefit of various institutions of the occupying Power. Quasi-public organizations, such as the Jewish Agency, engage in material discrimination, in particular through the allocation of confiscated Palestinian land to Israeli Jews. /n/nIn their written submissions, the great majority of States participating in these proceedings, along with three intergovernmental organizations, concluded that the occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal. Kuwait firmly agrees with this view. In its Written Submission, Kuwait identified several reasons proving the illegality of this occupation. I will provide a brief overview of these reasons for the Court. /n/nThe occupation violates a series of jus cogens norms. First, the obligation to respect the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. The right of people to self-determination is a right clearly recognized in international law as evidenced by several instruments, and as submitted by 35 States and international organizations participating in these proceedings. This is articulated in Article 1 (2) of the United Nations Charter which defines the purposes of the United Nations including “[t]o develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace”. The same obligations are expressed in Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. /n/nSecond, Kuwait joins the participants in these proceedings who have concluded in their Written Submissions that the ongoing military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal because it violates the jus cogens prohibition on the use of force. Third, the occupying Power, by confiscating and annexing parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, violates the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force. This was underscored by 38 participants in the written proceedings. This fundamental norm was incorporated into Security Council resolution 242 of 1967 and reaffirmed in Security Council resolution 338 of 1973. Accordingly, the occupying Power does not have the right to claim sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967. /n/nFourth, the occupation is illegal because it obviously violates the law of military occupation. For instance, the occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is not of a minimal duration. Facts clearly demonstrate that it is intended to be prolonged and ultimately permanent. A permanent occupation constitutes a serious violation of international law. Based on the verifiable evidence available to us, it is indisputable that this is precisely what is happening in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This prolonged occupation and indefinite violation of the Palestinians’ right to self-determination renders the occupation illegal. Moreover, the conduct of the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violates the rules of international humanitarian law. In the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court stated that: “the Fourth Geneva Convention . . . is applicable in the [occupied] Palestinian territories.” The Court also determined that the Hague Regulations are reflective of customary international law and thus applicable to the conduct of the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Far from complying with the law of occupation, the actions of the occupying Power disregard international law. These actions include, inter alia, the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, confiscation of Palestinian public and private property, and its failure to protect Palestinians from violence caused by State actors and private parties, including, inter alia, armed illegal settlers. /n/nFinally, the occupation violates the jus cogens prohibition of apartheid. Twenty-one participants in these proceedings supported this in their Written Submissions, while fourteen maintained that the situation of apartheid qualifies the occupation as illegal under international law. The prohibition of apartheid is evidenced in various sources of international law. The occupying Power is bound by the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which it is a party. Furthermore, it shall abide by the prohibition of apartheid as enshrined in the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and the Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, which codifies customary international law. Several voices and independent experts have warned that the occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory amounts to a régime of apartheid. For instance, in March 2022, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 in his report reached a similar conclusion."

Its breaches of these rights and obligations engage the occupying Power’s international responsibility. The occupying Power must therefore take several measures. First, it must provide Palestinians with relief in accordance with the principles of customary international law on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts.

        "texto": "Indeed, Israel’s genocidal war on the people of Gaza has shown that the situation in Palestine is the most pressing threat to international peace and security. As Secretary-General Guterres emphasized, recent events did not occur in a vacuum. Rather, they grew out of Israel’s illegal 57-year occupation of the Palestinian territories. Israel has denied the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. It has ethnically cleansed and colonized Palestinians’ lands. Furthermore, it has implemented an apartheid régime, that is to say, a régime of systematic racial oppression and discrimination, established with the intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. To maintain that régime, it has killed, maimed and imprisoned tens of thousands of men, women and children. These are the root causes of the situation we face today. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court: Israel’s illegal and discriminatory policies and practices are the tools of a long-standing settler-colonial project. As Qatar explained in its Written Statement, these policies are designed to promote a single goal: the permanent colonization of the Occupied Palestinian Territory for the exclusive benefit of Israel and the Jewish Israeli settlers. This goal is essentially linked to Israel’s oppressive and discriminatory practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and is the root cause of the cycles of violence there. /n/nIn Chapter 2 of its Written Statement, Qatar described in detail the eight main categories of discriminatory policies and practices that Israel employs in furtherance of its settler-colonial project. In Chapter 3 of its Written Statement, Qatar explained that these policies and practices entail flagrant violations of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, and constitute a crime against humanity, war crimes, genocide and ethnic cleansing. /n/nIt is Qatar’s position that, in order to fully respond to question (a), the Court should assess the legality of each of Israel’s main policies and practices through these lenses. A fulsome response to question (a) is no less than a clear answer to question (b). The Court should not underestimate the impact that findings of fact and law will have in bringing Israel’s specific policies and practices to an end, to encouraging accountability and to provide victims with a sense of justice. /n/nThe first central feature of Israel’s settler-colonial project is, of course, settlement. /n/nThe establishment and development of Jewish Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory began immediately after Israel occupied it in 1967. Israel establishes Jewish Israeli settlements on seized Palestinian lands, finances and facilitates the construction of housing and infrastructure, and incentivizes Jews from around the world to settle there. /n/nBy 2023, over 700,000 settlers, or approximately 11 per cent of Jewish Israelis, were living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nThe settlement activity is relentless. In a January 2024 report, which you can find at tab 3 of your folders, the Israeli human rights group Peace Now explained how the war in Gaza has been exploited as cover for an unprecedented surge in settlement activities. /n/nThe same is happening in East Jerusalem. /n/nAnd even Gaza is now at risk. The Israeli Security Minister recently stated that “[n]ot only do I not rule out Jewish settlement [in Gaza], I believe it is also an important thing.” On 28 January 2024, a conference dedicated to the resettlement of Gaza was held in occupied Jerusalem, which was attended by 12 Israeli government ministers. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court: let me pause here to make a brief remark about the situation in Gaza as it relates to the advisory proceedings. The contentious proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention do not mean that the recent situation in Gaza should not be addressed here. Gaza is part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was occupied before 7 October and it is occupied today. Israel’s policies and practices referred to in question (a) include its policies and practices in Gaza. The Court will examine the situation in Gaza through the lens of the Genocide Convention in the case brought by South Africa. Here, the Court can, and indeed must, apply all aspects of international law to the situation in Gaza, including well before 7 October. /n/nThis brings me to Israel’s second central policy and practice in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is displacement. In order to establish its settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel seizes public and private land, and forcibly displaces Palestinians. It does so through home demolitions, evictions, building restrictions and by establishing buffer or military zones. /n/nAgain, the situation has only grown worse since 7 October 2023. As is well established, Israel has forcibly displaced at least 75 per cent of the population of Gaza. /n/nThis policy is promoted by Israeli leaders as a solution to their Palestinian “demographic problem.” Israeli Minister of Culture stated that the Palestinians “can go to Ireland or [to the] deserts, the monsters in Gaza should find a solution by themselves.” /n/nWhile all eyes may be on Gaza, the situation in the West Bank is rapidly deteriorating. At least 13 different communities in the West Bank have faced forced displacement since 7 October. That has resulted in a north-south stretch of 20 km east of Ramallah being cleared of nearly all Palestinians. /n/nThe third Israeli practice is fragmentation. /n/nIn order to implement the demographic and physical control necessary to perpetuate the occupation and establish further settlements, Israel divides and isolates Palestinians. It relegates them to fragmented enclaves, restricts their movement and renders their daily lives all but unlivable. This is what Namibia and Belize aptly refer to as “strategic fragmentation.” /n/nIsrael has imposed a full blockade on Gaza since 2007, entirely cutting its population off from the rest of the world. On 7 October, Gaza had already been described by the United Nations Secretary General as “hell on earth.” Today it is indescribable. /n/nIn the West Bank, Israel has for decades implemented a system of draconian checkpoints, subjecting millions of Palestinians to daily indignities. Human Rights Watch has documented “more than 40 kilometers of West Bank roads that authorities prohibit Palestinians from traveling on.” /n/nSince 7 October, Israel has implemented an unprecedented lockdown on the entire civilian territory of the West Bank. It has closed much of its vast network of checkpoints, completely cutting off cities, towns and villages from each other. /n/nThe fourth practice that characterizes Israel’s occupation is its discriminatory and unlawful violence. /n/nIsraeli forces and Jewish Israeli settlers — often with the support of the State — use violence to crush even non-violent resistance to the occupation and to perpetuate a climate of fear and repression. /n/nIsraeli violence has been part of the fabric of life for Palestinians even before the beginning of the occupation in 1967. And Gaza has always paid the highest price. In the 15 years before 7 October, Israeli military campaigns killed 5,365 Palestinians in Gaza, the majority of whom were undisputedly civilians. Of course, this shocking statistic pales in comparison to what we have seen in the past four months. /n/nAt the same time, the Court cannot ignore the ever-worsening situation in the West Bank. /n/nSince 7 October, 397 Palestinians have been killed across the West Bank, and 453 have been injured. Even before 7 October, 234 Palestinians had been killed in 2023, which was the highest number on record. /n/nCivilian casualties are not just collateral damage in Israeli attacks, they are the main target. The use of warplanes, armed drones, attack helicopters and missiles was once unprecedented in the West Bank. Now it is routine. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court: Israel’s victims are often children. They include five-year-old Ruqaya, who was shot in the back by Israeli forces on 7 January at a military checkpoint in the West Bank. Her body was withheld from her family by Israeli forces for 10 days. Just last week, Israeli forces also shot 16-year-old Neehel in the head, killing him as he was leaving school. Neehel was the one hundredth Palestinian child killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since 7 October. /n/nThis brings me to the fifth practice implemented by Israel, which is its discriminatory military legal system in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This system privileges Jewish Israeli settlers while depriving Palestinians of the most basic legal protections. A pillar of this system is the practice of indefinite administrative detention of Palestinians without charges. As we detailed in our Written Statement, this practice was widespread before 7 October. Its use has increased excessively since then, in what some rights groups have characterized as mass enforced disappearances. In the past four months alone, thousands of Palestinians have been placed in administrative detention. In Gaza, they are rounded up, blindfolded, disrobed, humiliated and detained en masse in makeshift outdoor prisons. You can find detailed reporting at tabs 5 and 6 of your folders."

        "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, the Written Statements and Comments that addressed question (b) overwhelmingly endorse a finding by the Court that Israel’s occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal. This was the express conclusion of at least 38 Participants in these proceedings, with at most two States reaching the opposite conclusion. /n/nThose Participants finding that the occupation is illegal offered a number of lines of analysis to support their shared conclusion. This is unsurprising. Israel’s occupation has violated so many fundamental principles of international law that it would be hard to point to just one reason for its illegality. /n/nIn Chapter 3 of Qatar’s Written Comments, we identified five main reasons as to why Israel’s occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal. With its Written Comments, Qatar also submitted a detailed appendix, compiling relevant statements by participating States and international organizations. These can be found at tabs 7 to 15 of your folders. We hope that Qatar’s analysis will be helpful for the Court’s work. /n/nFirst, the occupation contravenes the jus cogens obligation to respect the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. Thirty-nine States and international organizations found that the occupation violates the right of self-determination. Twenty-eight of those Participants underscored that the occupation has become illegal for this reason. /n/nSecond, Israel’s occupation also violates the jus cogens prohibition of apartheid. Twenty-five Participants endorsed a finding of apartheid. Among those reaching this conclusion, 16 Participants underscored that the situation of apartheid renders the occupation itself illegal. /n/nThird, Israel’s occupation is illegal because it violates the jus cogens prohibition on the use of force. This was the conclusion of 18 Participants. /n/nFourth, by virtue of its illegal annexation of portions of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel has breached yet another jus cogens norm, the prohibition on the acquisition of territory through the use of force. At least 41 Participants in the proceedings have pointed this out, with 31 of them underscoring that the occupation is illegal as a whole because Israel’s annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is an integral feature of the occupation. /n/nFifth and finally, Israel’s occupation is illegal due to the fact that it is not of a temporary character, not being carried out in good faith or not being administered in the best interests of the occupied population. Seventeen States reached such conclusions. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the State of Qatar endorses all of these arguments for the illegality of the occupation. While it is of course for the Court to decide how best to answer the General Assembly’s question (b), it is Qatar’s respectful submission that the Court should not limit itself to choosing only one of these grounds for illegality. Unlike contentious cases, judicial economy does not support the adoption of only the narrowest reasoning possible in these proceedings. To the contrary, in the context of an advisory opinion, the Court’s function is to provide legal advice to the organ requesting the opinion. There are multiple relevant legal régimes applicable to the situation, and the Court’s advice on each of these frameworks will be of immense value to the General Assembly and to the international community at large. /n/nIn this connection, Qatar and many other States attach particular importance to a finding that Israel’s occupation, by its nature, amounts to a régime of apartheid. /n/nA finding of apartheid is not just the most accurate label for what the occupation has become. It also provides a tangible but flexible roadmap for what must come next. What ending apartheid requires is achieving a situation in which all people — Israelis and Palestinians — equally enjoy their fundamental human rights and dignity. With the requisite finding of apartheid by the Court, the international community, including the General Assembly, can activate similar mechanisms for bringing about an end of the occupation as it did with the apartheid régime in South Africa. This is the surest path to truth, justice, and yes, reconciliation."

        "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
        "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, I come to my first point. The Palestinian people have, as the Court itself has recognized, the right to self-determination. This right, which is codified in the two United Nations Human Rights Conventions, is “one of the essential principles of contemporary international law”. All States have a legal interest in protecting that right, which has the status of jus cogens. Israeli measures that severely impede the exercise by the Palestinian people of the right to self-determination are in breach of Israel’s obligations to respect that right. Pakistan strongly believes in the inherent right of people to live freely and in the justice of struggle for freedom from alien subjugation under the right of self-determination. /n/nI turn to my second point: the question of Israel’s occupation and annexation. It has always been the position of the United Nations that it “cannot condone a change in the status juris resulting from military action contrary to the provisions of the Charter. The Organization must, therefore, maintain that the status juris existing prior to such military action be re-established by a withdrawal of troops, and by the relinquishment or nullification of rights asserted in territories covered by the military action”. /n/nThus, after the Six-Day War, the Security Council determined in resolution 242 (1967) that Israel must withdraw its armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict. In resolution 476 (1980), the Security Council reaffirmed “the overriding necessity for ending the prolonged occupation of Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967”. /n/nIsrael’s occupation is no longer, if it ever was, a military occupation; it is annexation. In East Jerusalem, the annexation is de jure; in the rest of the territory, it is de facto. But the formal characterization matters little. To use the words of the Court in the Wall case, the occupation is today, “notwithstanding the formal characterization . . . tantamount to de facto annexation”. This now applies to the entire territory. This may have been the intention all along. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion affirmed in 1950 that “the Israeli Empire must comprise all the territories between the Nile and the Euphrates”, and this was to be achieved as much by invasion as by diplomacy. More recently, Prime Minister Netanyahu has declared that his Government will be “applying Israeli sovereignty over all the communities formed through the transfer of Israeli settlers and not one residential community will be uprooted”./n/nThrough its settlement policy, Israel has sought to create “irreversible facts on the ground”. It has aimed to create physical facts which in practical terms make it as difficult as possible to bring an end to its prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Notwithstanding, the Security Council has reaffirmed that the settlements constitute “a flagrant violation under international law”. /n/nAs this Court said in the Namibia case: “A binding determination made by a competent organ of the United Nations to the effect that a situation is illegal cannot remain without consequence.” As in that case, in answering the legal questions now referred to it, the Court is not concerned with the question of what practical steps would be required to cease the occupation. /n/nI come to my third point, regarding systematic racial discrimination. Israel’s policies and practices amount to systematic racial discrimination and apartheid. Israel has imposed a system of racial discrimination against the Palestinian people since 1967. It is a system that distinguishes — deliberately and systematically — along ethnic and religious lines between the Palestinian population and Jewish Israeli settlers illegally transferred into the territory. The purpose of domination and oppression may be inferred from Israel’s pattern of conduct against the Palestinians. /n/nI turn to my fourth point: Jerusalem and its holy places. The Holy City of Jerusalem is unique in that it is sacred to all three Abrahamic religions. Under the historic status quo, it is the right of Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities freely to access and worship at their holy places in the city. Ottoman decrees set out these rights in the nineteenth century. The régime was later confirmed in multilateral and bilateral instruments. The historic status quo has today developed into a so-called “objective régime”, which captures the point that it is characterized by a permanence which the instruments that established it do not themselves necessarily enjoy. Every State interested therefore has the right to insist upon compliance with this régime. /n/nUnder Israel’s prolonged occupation, Christians have not been free to access or worship in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Muslims have not been free to access or worship at Haram al-Sharif and in the Al Aqsa Mosque, to name only some prominent sites. The rights under the historic status quo must immediately be restored. This issue is of great importance to Pakistan, which is home to the second largest Muslim population in the world. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, any conclusion could not be reconciled with the Court’s Opinion on Namibia. There are certain clear parallels with the present case. The General Assembly had condemned South Africa’s occupation of Namibia, characterizing this as an “occupation” that engaged the Geneva Conventions, and the Security Council had expressly called for South Africa’s withdrawal. /n/nIn a later resolution, after condemning South Africa’s non-compliance with the earlier resolutions, the Security Council had also declared that “the continued presence of the South African authorities in Namibia is illegal”. This is to be understood as a reference to illegality under the rules on the use of force. Notably, the United States voted in favour of this resolution. With respect to Palestine, however, it now appears to wish to limit those rules to governing the lawfulness of the “the initial resort to force” “leading to an occupation” only. Of course, that could not be correct, including because it would allow an aggressor to benefit from an ongoing attempt to acquire territory through annexation. /n/nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court found that South Africa’s application of the apartheid régime to occupied territories amounted to disowning the Mandate. In this connection, the Court relied on a context specific expression of the general principle that no State can benefit from its own wrong, stating “[o]ne of the fundamental principles governing the international relationship thus established is that a party which disowns or does not fulfil its own obligations cannot be recognized as retaining the rights which it claims to derive from the relationship”. /n/nSouth Africa had claimed it had an independent right to administer the territory by reason of its “long occupation”. Evidently, the Court disagreed. Three points follow from this. /n/nFirst, the Court in Namibia case implicitly recognized that neither the fact of an occupation nor the law of occupation confer upon the occupying Power any legal entitlement to administer the territory. Any contrary view would allow an occupying Power to benefit from its unlawful use of force. /n/nSecond, the Court made a positive finding that South Africa’s occupation was unlawful. In Namibia, there was a binding Security Council decision to that effect. The Security Council has made no such Security Council decision with respect to Palestine. But this in no way displaces or impedes the Court’s judicial function in determining this legal question for itself. /n/nThird, the Court plainly did not consider that South Africa’s continued status as an occupying Power made any difference. /n/nAs Judge Greenwood has explained, the basic position under the law of occupation is that an occupying Power has the “liberty to govern within certain limits without being guilty of a violation of the ius in bello”. The occupying Power is required to administer the territory as a temporary conservator or trustee for the benefit of the occupied population. Acting in that capacity, the occupying Power has certain liberties to take measures in good faith in the best interests of the occupied population or, where absolutely necessary, to meet its own legitimate security interests. This, of course, is a separate question to the unlawfulness of the occupation itself. /n/nAs to the position under the law of occupation, again, it is helpful to recall the Namibia case. The Court’s context specific expression of the principle was that “a party which disowns or does not fulfil its own obligations cannot be recognized as retaining the rights which it claims to derive from the relationship”. Pakistan considers that this has relevance when considering whether an occupying Power should be recognized as retaining liberties to administer the occupied territory. /n/nIn this case, if one were to zoom in exclusively on Israel’s conduct as an occupying Power, the only conclusion could be that Israel has disowned its basic duties. Its policies and practices of occupation deny the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and amount to systematic racial discrimination and serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights. Plainly, they cannot be said to be absolutely necessary to meet Israel’s own security interests. They serve Israel’s other interests, including its goal of acquiring the territory."

        "texto": "The Court has heard various competing submissions this week with respect to question (b) of the request, but there can be little doubt as to the central importance of three matters: /n/n(a) First, the role of the rules on the use of force in governing the unlawfulness of a given occupation itself. /n/n(b) Second, the series of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions that have consistently and expressly called for Israel’s withdrawal and referred to “the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war”, which is a corollary of those rules. /n/n(c) Third, the Court’s Advisory Opinion on Namibia is a helpful reference point for the Court. /n/nAs to this case, if the Court agrees with Pakistan and with many other States that Israel is in continued breach of these fundamental primary obligations, it cannot allow Israel to benefit from its own ongoing wrongs by somehow avoiding the natural consequences that must follow under this law of State responsibility. These include the obligations of cessation and non-repetition which require immediate and unconditional withdrawal, as well as the obligations of non-recognition and non-assistance for all other States. /n/nAs to the applicable primary rules, it is customary international law and the Charter that govern the illegality of a given occupation at any point in time. As a separate matter, international humanitarian law governs the conduct of an occupying Power with respect to the occupied population. /n/nBut if the occupation itself is unlawful, that carries legal consequences for Israel and for all States under the secondary rules of State responsibility. Those legal consequences are in no way displaced by separate consideration of the lawfulness under international humanitarian law of particular conduct in the course of the occupation, much less by hope for a negotiated solution. Any other approach would effectively permit Israel to benefit from its own wrongdoing. /n/nFor the same reason, there is no scope for an argument that other States, in their dealings with respect to Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territory, could somehow put to one side the question of the unlawfulness of the occupation itself. They could not, for example, elect instead to focus exclusively on the different questions of whether specific Israeli measures were absolutely necessary to meet legitimate security requirements such that those measures are not unlawful under international humanitarian law. /n/nIndeed, in its 1971 Advisory Opinion, the Court itself concluded that, “the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia [is] illegal”. The Court held that South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw immediately and that all States were under an obligation to recognize the illegality of the occupation. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court. I conclude. With the general principle that no State can benefit from its own wrong firmly in mind, it cannot be right that, as some States have suggested, the Court should refrain from finding that the occupation itself is unlawful or that there is no obligation to withdraw. This would be to allow Israel to profit from its own continued grave wrongs. And, to adopt the Court’s words in Namibia, the Court “would be failing in the discharge of its judicial functions”. Such abdication of responsibility would not encourage or facilitate the achievement of a negotiated solution on the basis of international law. More generally, the Court would be sending out a clear signal to other States that they too might be allowed to benefit through the prolonged unlawful occupation of the territory of another State."

Pakistan supports this call. /n/nOn 26 October 2023, Pakistan was pleased to vote in favour of the General Assembly resolution which reaffirmed that: “a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved . . . in accordance with international law, and on the basis of the two-State solution”. Two months later, on 22 December 2023, the Security Council reiterated its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two States, consistent with international law and relevant United Nations resolutions. /n/nAnd these — and numerous other — resolutions by the political organs of the United Nations make clear, a two-State solution, and negotiations leading to it, must be consistent with international law. “Negotiations”, Judge Al-Khasawneh of this Court observed in the Wall case, “are a means to an end and cannot in themselves replace that end”.

It is also in breach of the principles of necessity and proportionality. /n/nIt is indeed against the prohibition of aggression, a peremptory norm of international law, from which no derogation is permitted /n/nSecond, the illegal annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nAs an occupying Power, Israel is legally obliged to keep its occupation temporary. /n/nThis has been violated by Israel as it has been attempting to make its occupation permanent and also to annex parts of the occupied territory. /n/nAs a matter of law, under no circumstances shall Israel be allowed to annex any part of the occupied territory. /n/nThe United Nations Security Council, in its various resolutions, has reaffirmed the established principle that acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible. /n/nIt is an absolute principle that applies even in circumstances where war has been resorted to lawfully, such as in self-defence, which is certainly not the case for Israel. /n/nIsrael’s transgression to international law does not stop there as it has declared that Jerusalem is the “eternal undivided capital” of Israel /n/nNot only are these actions unlawful, they are also highly prejudicial to the prospect of a two-State solution. /n/nThird, continued expansion of illegal settlement. /n/nThe policy of Israel in transferring its own population and forcibly displacing Palestinians from the occupied territory contravenes the fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. /n/nThe policy of Israel in transferring its own population and forcibly displacing Palestinians from the occupied territory contravenes the fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. /n/nIt is worsened by Israel’s pursuit to change the demographic composition of the West Bank. /n/nThis policy demonstrates Israel’s complete disregard of international law and also shows the intention to make the situation irreversible. /n/nFourth, the apartheid policy against the Palestinians. /n/nAs an occupying Power, Israel is legally obliged to act in the best interest of the Palestinians. /n/nInstead, Israel has been reinforcing its prolonged occupation by imposing military orders on the Palestinian population which are not applied to Jewish Israeli settlers. /n/nThe existence of separate legal régimes that are applied exclusively on different groups of people is a textbook apartheid policy that constitutes a grave violation of human rights, particularly crimes against humanity. /n/nHaving said that, it is clear that the continuation of such apartheid régime is paramount to another breach of a peremptory norm of international law. /n/nThis should begin with respect to the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, particularly the right to self-determination which has been systematically denied by Israel. /n/nIt follows that we must bring this illegal situation to an end."

        "texto": "Today, Palestinians have had to endure the seizure of their land and property, illegal settlements, unlawful killings, forced displacement, drastic movement restrictions, the denial of refugees’ right to return and of equal nationality and citizenship. The lived reality of the people of Palestine evokes painful memories for many Namibians of my generation. Namibians still experience the entrenched and structural impact of inequality, as a direct consequence of colonialism and the prolonged unlawful occupation. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, we ask you not to look away, either. Rather, we appeal to you: once again, end a historic and ongoing injustice by upholding the fundamental rights of a dispossessed people who have endured 57 years of a suffocating occupation. Today, Palestinians are enduring collective punishment in the besieged Gaza Strip, with civilians being killed in continuous and indiscriminate bombardments at a scale that is unprecedented in recent history. This state of affairs — this “hell on earth” — represents a stain on the collective conscience of the world. /n/nFirst, in so far as the law of occupation envisages any belligerent occupation as a temporary measure, immediately following military operations, Israel’s prolonged — or permanent — occupation breaches the law of occupation. It is a de facto annexation in all but name. /n/nSecond, Israel’s occupation, in and of itself, is unlawful under general international law. This is because it violates the Charter of the United Nations and peremptory norms; specifically, the prohibition on territorial acquisitions through illegal use of force, the principle of self-determination, and the prohibition of apartheid. /n/nThird, successive resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have declared Israel’s occupation to be illegal and called on Israel to end it immediately. These resolutions provide an independent source of authority for the illegality of the occupation. /n/nFinally, the continuation of the illegal occupation does not absolve Israel of its obligations and responsibilities under international law. This is consistent with your own conclusions in the Namibia Advisory Opinion that “[p]hysical control of a territory, and not sovereignty or legitimacy of title, is the basis of State liability for acts affecting other States”. /n/nWe also do so on account of the fundamental importance of the Court’s 1971 Namibia Opinion, where this Court declared that the policies of apartheid “constitute a denial of fundamental human rights” and are “a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the [United Nations] Charter”. /n/nBut above all, we do this because, notwithstanding the egregious nature of apartheid — as a State delict, as a violation of a peremptory norm and as a crime — it has received virtually no clarification beyond the specific circumstances of southern Africa. An advisory opinion on threshold questions of apartheid will therefore assist the General Assembly in respect of its own action, in identifying the key elements of the illegality and in formulating appropriate responses to Israel’s discriminatory practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nFirst, we respectfully ask the Court to make it clear that the prohibition of apartheid is not limited to southern Africa in the last century. It extends to Israel’s policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory today. Article 3 of CERD places all States parties, including Israel, under an obligation to prevent, prohibit and eradicate apartheid “in territories under their jurisdiction”. This is also the conclusion of the CERD Committee. The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, negotiated after the end of apartheid in South Africa, also recognized apartheid as a crime against humanity without temporal or geographical restriction. /n/nSecond, the Court should also confirm that the prohibition of apartheid binds all States as a peremptory norm. In your decision in the case under CERD brought by Qatar against United Arab Emirates, you acknowledged the “universal character [of CERD] is confirmed by the fact that 182 States are parties to it”. The International Law Commission and its Special Rapporteur on jus cogens (as Judge Tladi then was) have also expressly recognized the peremptory character of the prohibition of apartheid. /n/nFinally, Namibia invites the Court to clarify the definition of apartheid. Namibia aligns itself with other participants that the definition in Article 2 of the Apartheid Convention incorporates the three key elements of the delict under international law. /n/nFirst, the State must engage in one or more “inhuman acts”. Crucially, these take the form of violations of fundamental human rights within an institutionalized framework of systematic oppression and domination. /n/nSecond, these inhuman acts must be directed against a “racial group” or its members. /n/nFinally, the State must commit these inhuman acts “for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination” by one racial group over the other and “systematically oppressing them”. /n/nOther participants have already made extensive statements on the discriminatory and inhuman acts carried out against the Palestinians as a racial group. These policies and practices are too many to enumerate in the time available. They include laws that discriminate in matters of citizenship, ownership and transfer of property, and freedom of movement. The systematic and excessive use of force against Palestinian civilians, the arbitrary killings and mass incarceration of Palestinians, including children; the illegal settlements; the discriminatory residency regulations; and, crucially, the denial of a Palestinian identity by refusing to recognize them as a people with a right to determine their own political destiny and to pursue social, economic and cultural development. /n/nNamibia’s submission will focus on the final requirement: the purpose of establishing, maintaining domination and systematic oppression. First, the term “domination” signifies a pervasive, all-encompassing, serious form of control over a group. Second, “oppression” implies prolonged cruelty, reflecting a sustained violation of human rights. Third, “systematic” implies the organized nature of violent acts and the improbability of their random occurrence. /n/nNamibia shares the view of other participants that Israel’s policies and practices meet the evidentiary standard for establishing the State delict of apartheid. The Israeli Government’s openly articulated aim is to ensure Jewish Israeli control of all facets of Palestinian life, as evidenced by legislation affirming Israel as the nation State of the Jewish people, with unique self-determination rights reserved for Jewish individuals only. /n/nIt is clear from all the available evidence that these discriminatory practices are not accidental or fortuitous but are designed for the specific purpose of privileging Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. The fact that the practices in question may have other collateral objectives, such as maintaining security, is irrelevant. It will suffice if the primary motive is discriminatory, even if it also serves ancillary purposes. /n/nIt follows in Namibia’s submission that Israel’s policies and practices are inconsistent with the prohibition of apartheid as a State delict under international law. Furthermore, these discriminatory practices, in the context of prolonged occupation of the Palestinian territories, violate the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. /n/nAs other Participants have highlighted, these discriminatory policies and practices are directed at fragmenting the Palestinian people. These elaborate systems of administrative controls undermine group cohesiveness by dividing the Palestinian people into a number of administrative “domains” or groups, with varying degrees of rights. This strategic fragmentation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory into Bantustans makes Palestinian life burdensome and in many cases unbearable, forcing them to leave their homes. /n/nPerhaps the epitome of discriminatory laws negating the Palestinian right of self-determination is the 2018 Basic Law, passed with constitutional status, which boldly declares that Israel is the nation of the Jewish people and that Jewish settlement is a national value. /n/nSince Israel’s policies and practices violate peremptory norms of international law, the occupation itself is unlawful. This entails consequences for Israel, for third States and, for the United Nations."

As is well known, that plan envisaged two States, one Arab and one Jewish. The Israeli Declaration of Independence makes this plain, by recognizing “the natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State”. If that logic applied to the self-determination and statehood of the Jewish people, it must by the same token also apply to the self-determination and statehood of the Palestinian people. /n/nCessation cannot be contingent on external factors such as the successful outcome of negotiations, as pointed out by some participants in these proceedings.

And here, Namibia aligns itself with Jordan’s Written Submission that all States are also under an obligation to recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including by exercising that right within a viable and independent State of Palestine. /n/nIn the Namibia Opinion, you already set out the legal consequences of unlawful occupation.

        "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
        "texto": "Israel’s occupation of Palestinian Territory has continued since 1967. Recent developments give rise to the utmost concern. They include ongoing indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force and other measures in the Gaza Strip, as well as illegal settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. House evictions, demolitions, forced displacement and settler violence against the Palestinian population are aspects of the Israeli occupation. /n/nSuch acts run counter to fundamental human rights, international humanitarian law and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. They threaten the foundations under international law for the vision of a region where two States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side within secure and recognized borders. Against this background, an advisory opinion will provide essential and timely guidance to the international community /n/nMr President, the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem constitute a chief obstacle to any prospect of settlement and peace in the area. In its Advisory Opinion of 2004 on the legality of the construction of a wall, this Court stated that “the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law”40. The Security Council has in numerous resolutions, including 2334 of 2016, restated its determination that the settlements constitute “a flagrant violation of international law”41 and stressed the need to reverse the negative trends on the ground, which are steadily eroding the two-State solution and entrenching a one-State reality. /n/nAt the outset, we recall that the definition of “occupied territory” in Article 42 of the 1907 Hague Regulations relies on a factual assessment. A territory is considered occupied when it is “actually placed under the authority” of the hostile army. This triggers key legal rules, in particular out of humanitarian considerations, notably pursuant to the Fourth Geneva Convention. /n/nThe factual assessment made by this Court at the time of the Wall Opinion remains, in our view, entirely true today: both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are integral parts of the territory occupied by Israel in 1967, irrespective of the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. The Security Council recently stressed in its resolution 2720 of 2023 “that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967” and reiterated “the vision of the two-State solution, with the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian State”, echoing its resolution 1860 of 2009. /n/nThe protection given to the civilian population by the laws of occupation continue to apply. This does, however, not impede a consideration of the legality of the occupation as such. The occupation has now lasted for more than half a century. While international law does not set any specific time limit, military occupation is, in essence, temporary42. This is evident from provisions such as Articles 6 (3) and 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and was recalled by the General Assembly in its resolution 77/126 in 2022, emphasizing “that the occupation of a territory is to be a temporary, de facto situation, whereby the occupying Power can neither claim possession nor exert its sovereignty over the territory it occupies”. Recognized authorities have reminded us that “the law on belligerent occupation is based on the assumption that occupation of foreign territory, being an extraordinary measure, may be justified for a limited time only”43. /n/nA military occupation cannot be permanent. If an occupation is allowed to be indefinite, then the distinction, under jus ad bellum, between occupation and annexation dissolves. Furthermore, risks are patent with regard to “deportations, transfers and evacuations” in breach of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Both this Court and the Security Council have found Israel to have violated this provision. Such developments give reason to ask whether the situation is turning into a de facto annexation. /n/nIn its Advisory Opinion on the Wall, the Court noted that “the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) . . ., pursuant to which ‘Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to . . . of their right to self-determination’”44. The Court notes in paragraph 149 that Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. /n/nIt added that there was a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the territory, contributing to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. On this basis, the Court concluded that the construction of the wall, along with measures taken previously, severely impeded the exercise by the Palestinian people to its right to self-determination and is therefore a breach of Israel’s obligation to respect that right. /n/nIn its 2019 Advisory Opinion on Chagos45, paragraph 160, the Court emphasized the customary law character of the right to territorial integrity of a non-self-governing territory as a corollary of the right to self-determination. It follows that any detachment by the administering Power of part of a non-self-governing territory, unless based on the freely expressed and genuine will of the people of that territory, is contrary to the right to self-determination. /n/nNorway believes that permanent or irreversible measures taken by Israel on Occupied Palestinian Territory would likewise be contrary to the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. /n/nI turn now to annexation. Annexation is a unilateral act by which a State incorporates into its territory all or part of the territory of another. As a concomitant of the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, annexation is prohibited under customary international law. /n/nThis prohibition is reflected in Security Council resolution 242 of 1967, referring to the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war”, repeated in its resolution 298 of 1971. It is on this basis that the Security Council in its resolution 469 of 1980 declared Israel’s de jure annexation of East Jerusalem to be “invalid”. /n/nWhat form annexation takes is irrelevant. To quote the Court: “With regard to the question of form, it should be observed that this is not a domain in which international law imposes any special or strict requirements”. This is why it must be reiterated that annexation under any form — whether de jure or de facto — is illegal under international law. The formal characterization is immaterial. /n/nNevertheless, there are grounds for asking whether Israel’s occupation may be seen as tantamount to de facto annexation, as the Court did in the Wall Opinion: “the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a ‘fait accompli’ on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation”46. /n/nIn its September 2022 report, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, held that “Israel treats the occupation as permanent and has — for all intents and purposes — annexed parts of the West Bank, while seeking to hide behind a fiction of temporariness. Actions by Israel constituting de facto annexation include expropriating land and natural resources, establishing settlements and outposts, maintaining a restrictive and discriminatory planning and building regime for Palestinians and extending Israeli law extraterritorially to Israeli settlers in the West Bank.”47 /n/nThe Commission considered the situation tantamount to a de facto annexation, as alluded to by the Court48. /n/nFirst, the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory represents a transfer, over decades, of parts of the occupying Power’s own civilian population into the territory it occupies, in breach of Article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Security Council has repeatedly, including in resolution 2334 (2016), condemned all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the territory occupied since 1967. /n/nSecond, it could be asked whether the duration of the occupation, which has now lasted for more than half a century, in itself renders the occupation tantamount to de facto annexation. /n/nThird, there are grounds for serious concerns regarding announced plans for further expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. /n/nFourth, Israel has appropriated natural resources of the West Bank, including water resources, and seized control of the physical infrastructure in order to bind the area closer to itself and, it seems, to render irreversible its presence in the territory49. Of particular concern are the repeated demolitions of the local Palestinian Bedouin communities and plans for infrastructure constructions that will isolate Bethlehem and the southern West Bank from East Jerusalem."

        "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
        "texto": "The Court has held consistently that its advisory jurisdiction cannot be used to undermine the fundamental requirement of State consent. Further, it should not provide “a form of judicial recourse” for parties2. Nor should the Court resolve disputes between parties using its advisory jurisdiction3. Instead, the Court’s advisory function is “to offer legal advice to the [UN] organs . . . requesting the opinion”4, “in order to assist them in their activities”5. /n/n Let me be clear: the United Kingdom does not submit that a State whose rights or duties may be affected by an opinion can prevent the Court from giving an opinion. Rather, consistent with the Court’s jurisprudence, the United Kingdom’s submission is that where a request is “directly related to the main point”6 of a dispute between two parties, then the Court should refrain from giving an opinion. In the words of the Court in Western Sahara, to give an opinion in such a case “would have the effect of circumventing the principle that a State is not obliged to allow its disputes to be submitted to judicial settlement without its consent”7. /n/nIf the Court were to answer the request as currently formulated, it would entail a breach of the non-circumvention principle. /n/nThe United Kingdom makes four key points: /n/n(1) The first point relates to the nature and content of the bilateral dispute. It is more than a mere “difference of views”8. It is a dispute of acute sensitivity. It is long-standing. It concerns the status of Israel’s occupation, issues of security and the conditions under which Israel can and should withdraw from the Occupied Palestinian Territories9. /n/n(2) Second, the request engages that core dispute. The General Assembly asks the Court to consider in express terms and rule on both the “legal status” of the occupied territories and the “legal consequences” of that status. The Court is also invited to make findings of Israeli responsibility in relation to its “policies and practices”. This engages key “permanent status issues” which are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, including on “Jerusalem”, on “settlements”, on “security arrangements” and on “borders”10. Indeed, a key Participant has described the Assembly’s request as “taking the entire Palestine question to be looked at by the highest court in the globe”11. /n/n(3) The third point concerns the relief requested. The Court is asked to determine that Israel’s occupation is unlawful and to order that Israel should withdraw immediately from the occupied territories as a result12. Over the course of this hearing, the Court has repeatedly been requested to order Israel’s “immediate, unconditional and total” withdrawal13. This repeated insistence further demonstrates that the Court is being asked to decide the “main point of the dispute”, which several States recognize14. /n/n(4) Finally, Israel has not consented to the main points of the dispute being resolved by this Court15. To the contrary, it has asked the Court to refuse to respond to the request16. Given the content of the request as currently formulated, there is thus no basis on which the Court should answer it. /n/nFirst, they say the Court can determine key issues relating to the parties’ bilateral dispute because it is of broader concern to the United Nations. Their argument relies on the Court’s recognition in the Wall Opinion17 that the General Assembly has a “permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine”18. The result, they say, is that the request arises in a “much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute”19. /n/nWith respect, the United Kingdom disagrees. The General Assembly’s consideration of a bilateral dispute does not mean that the non-circumvention principle is inapplicable. If it did, the principle would never apply in any advisory proceedings, since any bilateral dispute on which the Assembly made a request would always fall within the so-called “broader frame of reference”20. Such an approach would deprive the non-circumvention principle of all practical application. /n/nThis approach of the United Kingdom is consistent with the Wall Opinion. That opinion did not concern the core aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The Court itself accepted that it could not properly address what it referred to as “the greater whole” of the dispute21. Judge Higgins characterized that approach as “wise and correct”22. Judge Koroma was careful to distinguish the request in the Wall case from any such broader request that concerned “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as such” or “its resolution”23. And Judge Owada accepted that the Court’s answer should not “be tantamount to adjudicating on the very subject-matter of the underlying concrete bilateral dispute that currently undoubtedly exists between Israel and Palestine”24. /n/n A related point that several Participants have advanced is that the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is multilateral in character because it concerns erga omnes obligations25. The fact that a bilateral dispute may involve obligations in which States have a collective interest does not obviate the need for consent for that dispute to be resolved before the Court. Nor does it change the fact that there are two participants involved in that bilateral dispute. /n/nThe second counter-argument on non-circumvention is that the non-binding nature of advisory opinions means that a Court can opine on a bilateral dispute26. Like the first argument, this would deprive the non-circumvention principle of all practical application. By definition, Mr President, all advisory opinions are non-binding and so the principle would never apply in any advisory proceedings. /n/nThis ignores that the Court is being asked to make findings about Israel’s liability and responsibility for various alleged breaches of international law that are central to the bilateral dispute. The Court would in substance be deciding on the “main points” of the dispute if it were to answer the request as formulated, and that is precisely the problem that the non-circumvention principle is intended to avoid. /n/nThis submission also ignores that serious legal consequences may result from the Court’s findings27. This risk is even more pronounced since several Participants ask the Court to make legal determinations for the express purpose of clarifying the law relevant to the parties’ negotiations28. /n/nIn sum, the principle of non-circumvention is engaged in this case. Mr President, Members of the Court, if this fundamental legal principle is ever to have any real meaning or application, the Court must decline to answer the request as currently formulated."

        "texto": "The United Kingdom confines its submissions to relevant matters of legal principle, firmly founded on the Court’s own jurisprudence. We submit that the terms of the request do not allow the Court to give an opinion in a manner consistent with its judicial functions. The United Kingdom will focus today on three key points concerning propriety, which will be developed by Professor Sarooshi. They are: /n/n(1) first, the impact of the non-circumvention principle in this case; /n/n(2) second, the unsuitability of the fact-finding exercise that the Court would have to conduct to answer the request as presently framed; /n/n(3) third, the effect of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338. /n/nEach of these points independently provides a cogent reason for declining to answer the request. /n/nThe Court will have observed that our third reason has occupied a particularly prominent place in the Participants’ oral submissions. Should the Court be minded to issue an opinion, then the United Kingdom would respectfully urge it to reformulate the questions to concentrate on the Security Council framework. In this scenario, the Court should focus on assisting the General Assembly in supporting urgent progress towards a negotiated solution. I will address this point in concluding the United Kingdom’s submissions later. /n/nAllow me to highlight a few features of the factual determination process in this case: /n/n(1) The request in the present case makes no attempt to set out its factual basis. This stands in stark contrast to the Wall Opinion. In that case, the request by the General Assembly was based on assumed facts described in a single report by the United Nations Secretary-General31. /n/n(2) As one key Participant accepts, and as the Court’s jurisprudence reflects32, this means that “it is for the Court, in exercising its judicial function, to independently evaluate the factual materials that have been submitted to it”33. /n/n(3) In this case, the request asks the Court to determine a long list of legal issues and make the necessary factual findings to support them. This is by reference to the entire factual record stretching back some 57 years and a United Nations dossier spanning nearly 30,000 pages34. /n/n(4) As a matter of practicality, it is unclear how the Court can properly make the broad range of findings required to answer the request and consider such a volume of material especially when exercising its advisory jurisdiction where the Court cannot “fall back upon considerations of burden of proof”35. /n/n(5) It is no answer to assume that the Court can defer to the reports of United Nations bodies36. The Court must reach its own independent findings of fact. We emphasize that several States, including the United Kingdom37, have expressed reservations about these United Nations reports. /n/n(6) The Court’s task is further complicated by a factual landscape that is rapidly shifting in the context of an ongoing and active conflict38. This creates the serious risk that the Court may draw legal conclusions on an incorrect factual basis. /n/n(7) The problem is further heightened by the gravity of the accusations levelled against Israel, where it is not a party and where the proceedings have been expedited39. As this Court has long recognized, “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive”40. /n/nIn sum, the United Kingdom submits that there is a serious risk that the Court may undermine its judicial function by giving an advisory opinion in such a context. /n/nIn response to this submission, three main points have been raised by other Participants: /n/n(1) First, it is said, the negotiation process has been stalled for some time49. This does not negate the validity of the Security Council framework. Nor does it change the reality that a negotiated solution under the United Nations’ auspices is the only possible way in which this conflict will be resolved. It underscores the need to strengthen that process, rather than undermine it. /n/n(2) Second, some participants50 have referred to the Court’s jurisprudence on whether it should take account of adverse political consequences when considering propriety. The Court’s jurisprudence requires there to be an objective basis to assess the relevance of such consequences51. In this case, there is an objective basis. It is the established Security Council framework52. The General Assembly’s general mandate in respect of the Palestinian question cannot override the Security Council framework. /n/n(3) Third, it is argued that an opinion will not interfere with the Security Council framework or with negotiations conducted under its auspices. Instead, it is claimed, an opinion will assist that process53. Participants rely on the Court’s statement in the Wall Opinion that the negotiations must be conducted “in accordance with international law”54 and equivalent language in Council resolutions55. And so the Court’s legal conclusions can and should, they say, “constrain” the bases on which those negotiations are conducted56. With respect, Mr President, this argument is flawed: /n/n(a) It would undermine the very premise of the Council’s framework if the Court were to address the status of the occupation and require Israel’s withdrawal. As I observed earlier, that framework inextricably links withdrawal with security and applies on a reciprocal basis. An “unconditional” order directed at only one party contradicts that fundamental requirement. It also undermines the additional premise that Israeli withdrawal will be achieved by negotiation, rather than by a Court opinion. /n/n(b) Furthermore, an opinion addressing the parties’ obligations would prejudice their negotiating positions and thus contravene the Court’s injunction in the Interpretation of Peace Treaties and the Western Sahara Advisory Opinions that “the legal position of the parties to [a dispute] cannot be in any way compromised by the answers that the Court may give to the questions put to it”57. /n/nFor these reasons, the United Kingdom respectfully requests the Court to decline the request as presently formulated. /n/nThe United Kingdom agrees with those States that urge the Court not to cause prejudice to the existing Security Council framework64 or to decide any aspect of the parties’ bilateral dispute65. Like other participants66, the United Kingdom recognizes that an alternative route to respect propriety is to reinterpret the request or reformulate its terms. There is no question that the Court has the power to proceed in this way. It has “often been required to . . . interpret and even reformulate the questions put”67. As Judge Tomka has acknowledged, the Court can avoid intruding on a bilateral dispute by narrowing the scope of its answer68. /n/nThe question for the Court is how best to achieve these aims. We propose that the Court’s opinion should focus on endorsing the continued application of the agreed framework, with a view to ensuring its urgent implementation. An answer of this kind would respect the three propriety limitations that we have identified. It would also assist the General Assembly to discharge its mandate on “the Palestinian question”, which many participants have emphasized is the object of this request69. /n/nMore specifically, the United Kingdom in this alternative submission respectfully invites the Court to do the following: /n/n(1) to endorse the continued application of the Security Council framework to both parties and the need for its urgent implementation at the earliest possible opportunity; /n/n(2) to recall both parties’ obligations to respect the terms of the Council’s framework; /n/n(3) to recall both parties’ agreement not to aggravate their dispute by taking any step to change the status or integrity of the Occupied Territories until a negotiated solution is agreed70; and lastly /n/n(4) to reaffirm the parties’ obligations in their interim agreements that they negotiate on permanent status issues. /n/nIn this way, the Court could assist the General Assembly in achieving its stated objective, which is to support urgent progress towards a negotiated solution within the Security Council framework. The United Kingdom reiterates that a negotiated two-State solution is the only way in which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be resolved."

Nevertheless, the Court has consistently dismissed such objections. /n/nAs recalled by the Court in the Chagos Advisory Opinion, “[t]he fact that the Court has jurisdiction does not mean, however, that it is obliged to exercise it”. /n/nAccording to consistent jurisprudence of this Court, the discretion whether or not to respond to a request for an advisory opinion exists to safeguard the judicial function of the Court as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. /n/nHowever, the Court is aware that its reply to a request “represents its participation in the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused”.

This jurisprudential principle was confirmed by this Court in the Advisory Opinion on the Wall. /n/nThere is an additional pivotal aspect to address in this context. The two questions central to the ongoing advisory proceedings pertain to the existing conditions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court is not tasked with determining the content of a final settlement or the precise boundaries of the Palestinian State. /n/nEssentially, the request seeks the Court to provide an authoritative legal opinion on the current legal ramifications of the practices and policies of Israel referred to in the request. The advisory opinion is expected to bear relevance to extant queries regarding legal status and its associated consequences. Such clarification holds the potential to significantly contribute to establishing the groundwork for a prospective negotiated resolution of the underlying conflict, rather than to endanger the established framework for negotiations that have been suspended for several years now. Hence, the Sudan believes that this does not constitute a compelling reason to decline responding to the request./n/nIt is well-established jurisprudence of this Court that the lack of consent to the Court’s contentious jurisdiction by interested States does not impact the Court’s jurisdiction to render an advisory opinion. /n/nThis rationale is exemplified by instances such as when the Court gave its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, even in the absence of Spain’s consent to the request; when it delivered the Advisory Opinion on the Wall despite Israel not providing consent; and when it issued the Chagos Advisory Opinion, notwithstanding the absence of consent from the United Kingdom. In each of these instances the Court gave its opinions, even though the requests concerned the responsibility of particular States. /n/nThe General Assembly has consistently played a crucial role in matters concerning Palestine, as evident from the documentation presented in the Secretary-General’s dossier before this Court. The Palestinian people are yet to realize their right to self-determination, a fact that no State can plausibly contest. Therefore, the Sudan believes that the objection to the General Assembly’s exercise of its competence in the realm of self-determination and its consideration of the situation in Palestine is unpersuasive. /n/nIn the light of the foregoing, the Sudan concludes that the Court not only has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly, but also that there is no compelling reason for this Court to use its discretionary power not to give the opinion. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Members of the Court."

In advisory proceedings conducted before this Court, wherein the exercise of this right was a pivotal concern, the Court’s opinion emerged as fundamental elements shaping the legal framework for resolving the underlying disputes, such as the one concerning Namibia.

        "texto": "Today, the practices of Israel, the occupying Power, are definitely the clearest reflection — unfortunately — of the failure of the international community to prevent the heinous crime of occupation and to ensure the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. /n/nThe Syrian Arab Republic stresses the need to hold Israel accountable for its grave and continuing violations of the provisions of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and its relevant resolutions, and the provisions of international humanitarian law, including provisions in Section III of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, Articles 47 and what follows. /n/nThe right to self-determination is a fundamental human right that is enshrined, among other international instruments and conventions, in Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, providing that each State shall “refrain from any forced action depriving peoples . . . of their right to self-determination, freedom and independence” and that each State shall “encourage, through joint and unilateral action, the realization of the principle . . . of self-determination of peoples”. /n/nThis right is also reiterated and affirmed in common Article 1 between the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which obliges States that are parties to these Covenants to promote the realization and respect of this right, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. /n/nIsrael violates this right through, for example, the establishment and continued expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem. We note in particular the discriminatory Israeli legislation of 2018, or what is called the Basic Law: “Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People”, which recognizes the right to self-determination exclusively for the “Jewish people”, denying the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination on their land and in their homeland. I shall now turn to talk about the legal consequences. /n/nThe illegal Israeli settlements and the system associated with them are based actually on a dual process: on one hand, the forced displacement of Palestinians and the confiscation of their lands. And on the other hand, the transfer of Israeli settlers and the construction and expansion of settlements on confiscated lands. /n/nInternational humanitarian law prohibits the forced displacement of the occupied people and the transfer of citizens of the occupying Power to the occupied territories, as confirmed by Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention that provides for the protection of civilians in the time of war, thus forced displacement and transfer of citizens by the occupying Power constitute grave violations under Article 147 of the aforementioned Convention. /n/nIndeed, the actual annexation of parts of the occupied Palestinian land is embodied through a continuous gradual process involving the implementation of many measures and actions that include, among others, /n/n(a) settlements’ size, infrastructure, and location, which indicate the purpose to make them sustainable; /n/n(b) “Israeli” government plans and directives that allowed the establishment and expansion of settlements; /n/n(c) the legislation that enacted a dual legal system in the occupied territories in favour of the settlers at the expense of the occupied people, including the “Basic Law” of 2018: “Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People”. /n/n(d) another example: public statements of Israeli officials demonstrate to the fact that the settlements and the system associated with them constitute a deliberate policy of obtaining a permanent presence for the annexation of the territories and confirm that the actual annexation had already taken place; /n/n(e) the guidelines and coalition agreements of the new Israeli occupation authorities sworn in on 29 December 2022, in which they explicitly declare that the Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all areas of “Israel” and undertake to strengthen and develop settlements throughout what they called the “land of Israel” — in the Galilee, the Negev, the West Bank — and in the occupied Syrian Golan, despite the confirmation by United Nations Security Council resolution 497 (1981) that provides that “the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect”. /n/nMr. President, distinguished Members of the Court, in 1980 the Israeli Knesset adopted a “basic law” on Jerusalem, which states that “Jerusalem, whole and united” is the “capital of Israel”, effectively annexing the city, in flagrant violation of international law and of the City’s own international status. /n/nIn response, the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 478, which declared that “all legislative and administrative measures, and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and in particular the recent ‘basic law’ on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith”. Mr. President, since then, the Israeli occupation authorities have worked to consolidate further annexation instead of reversing it. /n/nSince its inception, “Israel” has adopted various discriminatory legislations aimed to ensuring its control over the maximum geography with the minimum possible number of Palestinians. /n/nThe United Nations Human Rights Council has described the “Israeli” discriminatory measures as “(1) a combination of movement restrictions consisting of the wall, checkpoints, a permit system that affects only the Palestinian population, (2) and the application of a two-tier legal system that facilitated the establishment and consolidation of settlements, (3) and other violations and forms of institutional discrimination”. /n/nThe United Nations General Assembly has always, and for many years, condemned, in a large number of resolutions, the discriminatory policies and practices of “Israel”, the occupying Power, against the Palestinians, as well as the Syrians in the occupied Syrian Arab Golan. These policies and practices include, according to these resolutions, “killing and injuring civilians, arbitrary arrests and detentions, in addition to forced displacement of civilians, transfer of settlers to the occupied Palestinian and Syrian territories, destruction and confiscation of civilian properties and demolishing homes”. /n/nYour honours, in the devastated Gaza Strip, long before 7 October 2023, “Israel” practices racial discrimination towards the Palestinian population in the form of its ongoing blockade. The discriminatory nature of the blockade actually imposed on the Gaza Strip was recognized by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This blockade was found to violate the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. /n/nThe actions of Israel are part of a large-scale, repressive, organized and systematic régime. Such actions have been identified as apartheid after a thorough factual and legal examination by the United Nations special procedures and by various international organizations. Apartheid is most manifested in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, where illegally located settlers benefit from far-reaching privileges at the expense of the basic rights of the Palestinian people. /n/nThe acts and practices of occupying Powers are strictly regulated by international law and international humanitarian law. Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates that “the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population to the territories it occupies”. /n/nWhile the occupying Power is obliged under international law to administer the territory for the benefit of the people under its occupation, Israel administers the territory only for the benefit of its settlers, and even to ensure the sustainability of the illegal occupation of others’ lands. /n/nWhile annexations or claims of sovereignty over territories under the interim administrative authorities of the occupying Power are strictly prohibited, Israel has sought to exercise fait accompli sovereignty over Jerusalem and the occupied Arab territories. /n/nMr. President, distinguished Members of this honourable Court, we believe, in the first place, that the Israeli occupation, in and of itself, should be considered absolutely illegal, and that we should not be satisfied with only and merely describing its practices and policies. Allow me now to move to the legal consequences. /n/nHonourable judges, the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms the principle that States shall not obtain legal rights from unilateral acts that do not comply with international law. Syria also re-emphasizes the temporary nature of the occupation, and that even if it is a fait accompli, this does not and will not give the occupying Power the right to acquire sovereignty over the occupied territories, no matter how long this brutal occupation lasts. /n/nIsrael is not only committing the horrendous acts that we have just mentioned, but we are currently witnessing Israel committing genocide in the occupied Gaza Strip, attacking Syria, attacking Lebanon, and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. In fact, one of the reasons for Israel’s consideration of itself as being above the law is that it has been carrying out illegal occupation and committing crimes for 75 years, without facing accountability or any sort of consequences."

Israel’s decades-long occupation has not only led to deprivation of Palestinian people of their fundamental rights, but also made them dependent on Israel’s mercy. Their properties are demolished, their land is usurped, their livelihoods are confiscated. Although they are living in the twenty-first century, the practices they have been subjected to are from the Middle Ages and sometimes even worse. Today, the Palestinian people only need emancipation and dignity. /n/nIsrael’s ongoing occupation and Israel’s ongoing and deliberately prolonged occupation and intransigent policies failing all initiatives have also left the Palestinians, who were expelled from homeland to neighbouring countries, in limbo, in despair and hopelessness  generation after generation. /n/nWe believe that all the unilateral acts and measures by Israel aimed at changing the character and status of the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, constitute a breach of international law and must be unconditionally rescinded. /n/nBy the same token, the situation in the occupied territories has not improved, despite numerous resolutions that the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council resolutions adopted over decades. Israel’s unlawful unilateral actions, that are considered null and void in many of the United Nations resolutions, are continuously putting the two-State vision in jeopardy. /n/nUnlawful settlement activity has intensified to the extent that it is now extremely difficult to mention contiguity of the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, which is a key to a lasting peace. /n/nTransfer of Israeli population in the form of settlements has been changing the demographic composition of the occupied territories. Demolition of houses of the Palestinians as well as forcible evacuations continue under the protection of the Israeli security forces. Also, settler violence is increasing day by day against native Palestinians. /n/nLocated in East Jerusalem, the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram Al-Sharif, is among the holiest sites for Muslims around the world.

This kind of brutal practice is becoming commonplace. /n/nOn 5 June 1967, Israel launched a military offensive and occupied the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegally. In the following period, several United Nations Security Council1 and General Assembly resolutions affirmed that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible under international law and “confirmed that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel which purport to alter the status of Jerusalem, including expropriation of lands and properties thereon, are invalid and cannot change that status”. /n/nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, basically, Israel is the occupying Power in the occupied Palestinian territories and under the obligation to abide by international law. Therefore, any Israeli acts and/or measures executed in the occupied Palestinian territories in breach of international law should be considered null and void. The practices as well as acts and measures violating human rights must be held to account. /n/nSince 7 October, more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far in Israel’s indiscriminate attacks on Gaza. Most of them are women and children. 2.3 million civilians have been placed under full blockade by Israel, depriving them of their basic needs to survive, such as water, food, medicine, fuel and electricity.

        "texto": "The persistence of this occupation, acts of genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, crimes against humanity, displacement of populations, imprisonment of Palestinians behind illegal segregation walls, expansion of illegal settlements, creating new political realities on the ground aiming at complicating the dismantling of the occupation  all  will never discourage Palestinians from claiming their legitimate inalienable rights. /n/nThe insistence on placing Israel above the law, through the politicization of accountability and adopting double standards in the application of justice is a direct threat to international peace and stability./n/nThis prolonged occupation is an affront to international justice. The failure to bring it to an end has led to the current horrors perpetrated against the Palestinian people, amounting to genocide. There can be no moral or juridical justification for occupying lands, killing, terrorizing and displacing their populations. /n/nWhen this began after the First World War, the Jewish population of that land was 11 per cent. Forcibly implementing Zionism in this demographic context has necessarily involved the extermination, or forced displacement of, some of the non-Jewish Palestinian population; the exercise of domination over, and subjugation, dispossession and immiseration of, remaining non-Jewish Palestinians; the emigration to that land of Jewish people, regardless of any direct personal link; and the denial of Palestinian refugees the right to return. All operating through a racist distinction privileging Jewish people over non-Jewish Palestinian people. /n/nThis has necessitated serious violations of all the fundamental, jus cogens and erga omnes norms of international law — the right of self-determination, the prohibitions on aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity, racial discrimination, apartheid and torture  and the core protections of international humanitarian law. /n/nDespite this, a State of Israel, specifically for Jewish people, was proclaimed in 1948 by those controlling 78 per cent — more than three quarters — of Palestine, accompanied by the forced displacement of a significant number of the non-Jewish Palestinian population — the Nakba, catastrophe. This illegal secession was an egregious violation of Palestinian self-determination. Israel’s statehood was recognized, and Israel admitted as a United Nations Member, despite this illegality. Israel is not the legal continuation or successor of the Mandate. /n/nFirst, Palestinian people not displaced from the land proclaimed to be of Israel in 1948, and their descendants, have been forced to live as citizens — presently they constitute 17.2 per cent — of a State conceived to be of and for another racial group, under the domination of that group, necessarily treated as second class, because of their race. /n/nSecond, Palestinian people displaced from that land, and their descendants, cannot return /n/nFor more than half a century, then, a State defined to be of and for Jewish people exclusively has governed the entire land of historic Palestine and the Palestinian people there. And the régime of racial domination — apartheid — and denying return, has been extended throughout. In the case of Palestinians living in the occupied territory, this has involved the same serious violations of international law, supplemented by serious violations of norms applicable in occupied territory. /n/nIndeed, these people are subject to an even more extreme form of racist domination, as they are not even citizens of the State exercising authority over them. Even in East Jerusalem, which Israel has purported to annex, the majority non-Jewish Palestinian residents do not have citizenship, whereas Jewish residents, including illegal settlers, are citizens. /n/nFirst, the law on the use of force. Here, the occupation is illegal both as a use of force without valid justification, and because it is enabling an illegal purported annexation. As such, it is an aggression. /n/nSecond, the law of self-determination. Here, it is illegal again because of the association with illegal purported annexation, and also, more generally, because it is, quite simply, an exercise of authority over the Palestinian people that, by its very nature, violates their right to freedom."

The Palestinian people are legally entitled to reject a further loss of land over which they have an exclusive, legal, peremptory right. Any such rejection makes no difference to Israel’s immediate legal obligation to end the occupation. /n/nFirst: the occupation must end: Israel must renounce its claim to sovereignty over the Palestinian territory; all settlers must be removed.

But this does not alter the more fundamental position, from the law on the use of force and self-determination, that Israel lacks any valid authority to do anything, and whatever it does is illegal, even if compliant with or pursuant to the conduct-regulatory rules."

        "texto": "Mr President and esteemed Members of the International Court of Justice, it is my great honour to appear before you today on behalf of the Republic of Fiji.\n\nMr President, for many decades Fiji has built a tradition of peacekeeping. Our commitment to world peace is unwavering and we are resolute in our efforts to contribute to global stability. I have personally had the privilege of leading peacekeeping operations in the Middle East over a period of more than 20 years.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, Fiji supports all efforts to establish a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. Efforts that recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the right of the Jewish State of Israel to exist as a sovereign State with secure borders. Efforts that emphasize the need for the parties to engage in constructive negotiations, as envisaged by the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n\nFiji affirms the important role of this Court as the highest judicial organ of the United Nations in resolving disputes between States and assisting United Nations organs in their activities.\n\nIn so doing, the Court must promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. According to Article 1 of the United Nations Charter, one of the main purposes of the United Nations is “to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples”. Fiji strongly believes that the only way to achieve truly sustainable peace between Israel and the Palestinian people  indeed between any neighbours  is through mutual respect.\n\nAs reflected in our Written Statement, Fiji considers it essential to maintain and uphold the legal framework agreed between the parties and sanctioned by the Security Council to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian dispute. That framework is founded on the understanding that Jews and Arabs must coexist in a small piece of territory. This requires direct negotiations between the parties for an agreed outcome.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, the General Assembly has requested the Court to answer certain questions that focus on the legal consequences of the policies and practices of only one party to this dispute.\n\nTo answer these questions, the Court would need to carry out an independent judicial assessment of both the law and the facts, on virtually every aspect of the Israel–Palestine dispute, taking account of the relevant context. This is not an easy task. As Judge Higgins noted in her separate opinion in the Wall Advisory Opinion: “[t]he law, history and politics of the Israel-Palestine dispute is immensely complex”. Further, “[c]ontext is usually important in legal determinations”.\n\nIn Fiji’s view, this Court has unfortunately been presented in these proceedings with a distinctly one-sided narrative. This fails to take account of the complexity of this dispute and misrepresents the legal, historical and political context.\n\nIn its Written Statement, Fiji has provided several reasons why the Court should exercise its judicial discretion not to render an advisory opinion on the questions that have been posed by the General Assembly:\nfirst, the request is a legal manoeuvre to circumvent the existing internationally sanctioned and legally binding framework for resolution of the Israel-Palestine dispute;\nsecond, to give an opinion in this case “would have the effect of circumventing the principle that a State is not obliged to allow its disputes to be submitted to judicial settlement without its consent”; and  third, due to the one-sided formulation of the questions posed in resolution 77/247, the Court does not have before it the accurate and reliable information that it would need to render an opinion on the questions posed.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, in this oral presentation I will address the first and third of these issues.\n\nI turn to the existing framework.\n\nIn these proceedings, the Court has been asked to render an advisory opinion that may well mean, in effect, the “immediate”, “unconditional” and “total” end to the occupation  that is, withdrawal of all Israeli military and civilians from the entirety of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. This withdrawal must not only be complete, but it must also be unconditional  in other words, Israel may not impose or require any limitations or conditions. This unconditionality is supposedly necessary in order that the Palestinian people have a sovereign State on such territory, which they assert is the only way to achieve justice and therefore peace.\n\nFiji respectfully submits that this demand of a complete and unconditional withdrawal circumvents the peace process and the agreements that have been made in pursuit of that process.\n\nMr President, the fact is that, from 1993, Israel and Palestine entered into the series of agreements known collectively as the “Oslo Accords”. The parties expressed the intention to “put an end to decades of confrontation and to live in peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity and security, while recognizing their mutual legitimate and political rights”. To that end, they agreed on a wide range of interim measures, pending the achievement of a final agreement through permanent status negotiations.\n\nSome of those interim measures include:\n\nThe Palestinian Authority was established.\n\nPowers and responsibilities were transferred from the Israeli military government and its civil administration to the Palestinian Authority, while Israel continued to exercise powers and responsibilities not so transferred.\n\nDirect, free and general political elections were to be held by the Palestinians.\n\nThe West Bank was divided into three areas: A, B and C. The Palestinians would obtain exclusive control over Area A; Area B would be under joint Israeli/Palestinian control; and Area C would be under exclusive Israeli control.\n\nLastly, the parties would enter negotiations on the permanent status to resolve the remaining issues, which included “settlements”, “borders”, “Jerusalem” and “security”.\n\nIn addition, the Oslo Accords contain a specific dispute resolution mechanism, and do not permit either party unilaterally to commence or ask others to commence external legal proceedings.\n\nSince 1993, an extensive set of arrangements has been put in place to operationalize the agreements.\n\nIn 2003, the General Assembly endorsed the Oslo Accords and the Security Council has “[e]ndorsed the Quartet Performance-based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict”. This Court itself confirmed the importance of the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap in the Wall Advisory Opinion in 2004.\n\nAccording to the Roadmap,\n“a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only be achieved through an end to violence and terrorism, when the Palestinian people have a leadership acting decisively against terror and willing and able to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty, and through Israel’s readiness to do what is necessary for a democratic Palestinian state to be established, and a clear, unambiguous acceptance by both parties of the goal of a negotiated settlement”.\n\nThe thrust of the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap is mutual performance and good faith negotiation, leading to a consensual outcome.\n\nThe Oslo Accords are legally binding. Remarkably, the Palestinians do not refer to these agreements in their Written Statement, while less than 12 months ago both Israel and Palestine reaffirmed their “unwavering commitment to all previous agreements between them” and “to address all outstanding issues through direct dialogue”.\n\nMr President, it is our submission that the request to this Court to opine on questions that address the legal obligations of only one party to this dispute conflicts with the clear rights and obligations of both parties in the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap, and which exclude recourse to this Court.\n\nFor this reason, Fiji respectfully submits that the Court should exercise its discretion not to render an opinion on those questions.\n\nMr President, Members of this honourable Court, I now turn to the issue of legal and factual evidence.\n\nAs stated, in Fiji’s view, the Court should decline to answer the questions posed. But were it to do so, it would need to gather and independently assess the probative value of evidence on issues raised within the established legal framework of the dispute.\n\nThis Court would have to decide, as it has previously explained,\n“whether [it] has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character”.\n\nIn Fiji’s view the Court cannot simply defer to the reports of United Nations bodies. In order to fulfil its judicial function, the Court must reach its own independent findings of fact.\n\nFurther, Fiji submits that, due to the selective and one-sided formulations of the questions, the Court does not have before it all the evidence it would need to exercise its judicial function.\n\nMr President and esteemed Members of the Court, the point here is that the Court is being asked to focus solely on the policies and practices of one of the parties to this dispute, to the exclusion of the policies and practices of the other. This is highly problematic. If the Court would limit itself to consideration of the questions asked, it would be unable to consider the relevant broader context, and it will also not have before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon questions of fact that are in dispute, all of which would be necessary to give an opinion compatible with its judicial character.\n\nWe will illustrate this by looking briefly at three of the issues raised by the questions that have been posed to the Court, and these are: withdrawal and security, territorial sovereignty, and the right to self-determination."

        "texto": "Mr President and Members of the Court, the General Assembly’s request speaks of Israel’s “prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967”. This asks the Court to presuppose that all the territories held during the Jordanian and Egyptian occupation within the 1949 Armistice Lines are “Palestinian” that is, that they are sovereign territories of Palestine and thus not of Israel.\n\nA precise definition of the scope of territorial claims is important because “[t]erritorial sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the international political and legal order. It ‘serves to divide between nations the space upon which human activities are employed, in order to assure them at all points the minimum of protection of which international law is the guardian.’”\n\nIn the context of the questions put to this Court, territorial sovereignty is critical because without clarifying the respective claims of Israel and the Palestinians concerning the sovereign status of the territory, it would be impossible to answer the questions of territorial scope of the Palestinian self-determination claim or the occupation.\n\nFiji notes that the question of territorial scope both of the State of Israel and of the self-determination claim of the Palestinian people is in dispute between the parties.\n\nAnd yet the way the questions are drafted excludes the possibility of the Court considering Israel’s claims to the sovereignty over the territory and asks the Court to assume without further investigation that these territories are somehow “Palestinian”.\n\nFurthermore, the Court would need to assess whether the Palestinians have sovereignty and, if so, over which territory. This would include an examination, among other things, of the history of Palestinian assertions of claims and of whether Palestinians make different assertions of sovereignty in different fora.\n\nPalestine asserts that the provisions in the Mandate for Palestine concerning the establishment of a Jewish homeland as envisaged in the Balfour Declaration were illegitimate and in contravention of the Covenant of the League of Nations. It appears to claim that all the territory of Mandate Palestine  even including what is generally accepted to be the territory of the State of Israel belongs to the Palestinian people.\n\nMr President, Israel asserts, and Fiji agrees, that the Mandate for Palestine, including its provisions concerning the establishment of the Jewish homeland, such as the right of the Jewish people to live in and closely settle the land, was a binding instrument of international law. Israel also argues that the relevance of the rights conferred by the Mandate for Palestine was affirmed in Article 80 of the United Nations Charter, the so-called “Palestinian clause”.\n\nThere is thus a dispute about territorial sovereignty. Fiji submits that this dispute cannot and should not be resolved through means of the requested advisory opinion, for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that the question of “borders” and therefore the scope of territorial sovereignty was expressly agreed to be resolved through the permanent status negotiations to which the parties have committed themselves in the Oslo Accords. For the reasons set out earlier, this precludes the matter being adjudicated via an advisory opinion procedure.\n\nThe second reason is that, in any event, because of the way the questions to the Court have been formulated, the Court simply does not have before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion on the disputed issue of the geographic limits of the territorial sovereignty of Palestine and Israel.\n\nI now turn to self-determination.\n\nThe questions before the Court ask it to assume that Israel is violating “the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination”.\n\nThe question of self-determination raises the question of territorial scope. This raises the evidentiary concerns I have just expressed.\n\nMoreover, Fiji notes that the right to self-determination is a relative right. It should not involve changes to existing frontiers. In the context of Israel/Palestine, this means that the Court would need to ascertain whether the Palestinians’ exercise of their right to self-determination has infringed the territorial integrity, political inviolability or legitimate security needs of the State of Israel.\n\nBy asking the Court to look only at the policies and practices of Israel, resolution 77/247 shields from the Court’s purview the policies and practices of Palestine. The result, in Fiji’s submission, is that the Court simply does not have before it sufficient information concerning the policies and practices of Palestine, and thus is unable to make a judicial determination on whether, in exercise of their right to self-determination, Palestine has infringed the sovereignty of the State of Israel."

As highlighted earlier, any assessment of the questions posed would require the Court to consider the legal rights and obligations of both parties under the Oslo Accords.\n\nThe Oslo Accords were built upon Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, which were adopted following the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli Wars. They recognize the legitimate security needs of Israel to prevent further attack.\n\nResolutions 242 and 338, and thus the Oslo Accords, do not oblige Israel to withdraw from all the territories.\n\nFurther, resolutions 242 and 338 refer to peace being established by the application of two mutually dependent principles: “(i) Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict; and (ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.”\n\nBy incorporating these resolutions into the Oslo Accords, the parties recognize that Israel’s withdrawal and the creation of conditions providing security to Israel are interdependent. As Judge Higgins stated in the Wall Opinion, both “Israel and Palestine [need] to move in parallel to secure the necessary conditions for Israel to withdraw from Arab occupied territory and for Palestine to provide the conditions to allow Israel to feel secure in so doing”.\n\nIn other words, if the Court is to consider the legal consequences of the alleged Israeli refusal to withdraw from territory, it should also look at what Palestine must do to ensure Israel’s security.\n\nMr President and Members of this honourable Court, the events of 7 October 2023 have shown us what could happen if there were a complete and unconditional withdrawal without the necessary arrangements in place to guarantee the security of Israel and its population. At the very least, the Court would need to examine and evaluate evidence concerning the question whether the in turn would require examination of the threats facing Israel emanating from the occupied territories and the broader region."

        "pregunta": "The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
        "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, representing the final State appearing, I have the honour of identifying the main points addressed during the course of this hearing on the violations by Israel of international law.\n\nThe Maldives provides this analysis with a focus on the issue of water resources. Why? Because of two streams of significance.\n\nFirst, the significance of water resources to the Palestinian people: in fact, it has been described as the “most vital resource in the [Occupied Palestinian Territory]” by Palestine. A tidal wave of suffering has been unleashed by Israeli policies and practices with respect to water resources, which are characterized by deprivation, denial, discrimination and destruction:\n\nDeprivation of access to water many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip simply have, I use the Court’s own words, “no access to potable water”.\n\nDenial of enjoyment of those resources on a discriminatory basis—in the West Bank, where Israel has seized control of water resources, use of vital groundwaters is marred by grossly inequitable allocations between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nDestruction of vital infrastructure, with Israel demolishing sanitation structures and pipelines. The second stream of significance is to the questions before the Court. The issue of water resources flows through four key aspects of the unlawfulness of Israeli policies and practices on which the Oral Submissions have focused. I address each aspect in turn.\n\nThe first key aspect: the violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The following points are crystal clear.\n\nFirst, the Palestinians are a distinct people with a right to self-determination, an inalienable norm of jus cogens.\n\nSecond, Israel’s conduct has violated different components of that right, notably the right to territorial integrity, the right not to be subjected to demographic manipulation within that territory by a foreign Power, the right of the people to pursue its chosen economic, social and cultural development and its right to exercise permanent sovereignty over its natural resources.\n\nThe critical importance of this well-established latter component the Palestinian people’s right to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources was recently stressed by the General Assembly in its resolution of December 2023. Such resources clearly include water. Israel’s policies and practices with respect to water resources the deprivation, denial on a discriminatory basis and destruction thus constitute one acutely serious and ongoing facet of the breach of the Palestinian people’s right of self-determination. Described by a United Nations body as “one of the most fundamental conditions for survival”, for a people sufficient clean water is indispensable.\n\nTurning to the second key aspect, the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force.\n\nThis afternoon, we have heard some attempts to muddy the waters in this regard, so I will recall the points of crystal clarity.\n\nFirst, a corollary of the jus cogens prohibition of use of force is the prohibition of any acquisition of territory by threat or use of force. Irrespective of international recognition of Palestine’s borders, the applicability of this prohibition to the Occupied Palestinian Territory cannot be in doubt, as expressly recognized in resolutions of both the General Assembly and Security Council.\n\nSecond, international law requires that occupation be temporary.\n\nThird, any purported exercise of the use of self-defence must be necessary and proportionate.\n\nFourth, and flowing from the three previous points, an occupying Power cannot acquire sovereignty over an occupied territory, including by annexation, irrespective of whether it claims to have acted in self-defence at any point during the occupation.\n\nYet Israel has annexed all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, whether through Israeli law or conduct manifesting a de facto annexation, creating a “fait accompli”. There is no shortage of evidence on this reality, as emphasized by many United Nations bodies and demonstrated by the map recently shown by the Prime Minister of Israel before the General Assembly referred to on the first day of this hearing.\n\nIsrael’s deprivation, denial on a discriminatory basis and destruction with respect to water resources is one facet of this annexation. The scale and nature of Israel’s conduct in this regard makes clear that it forms an integral element of Israel’s establishment of control through coercive measures reflecting its intention to appropriate that territory permanently, the occupation having (to quote the Special Rapporteur) “burst through the restraints of temporariness long ago”.\n\nIsrael’s settlement expansion is plainly another integral element of that annexation, with Palestinians reduced to inhabiting a “fragmented archipelago of disparate patches of land”.\n\nOf course, the different aspects of Israel’s violations of international law are not watertight from one another. Such prolonged occupation, annexation and settlement expansion also violate the right of self-determination, to which I referred earlier, a right which cannot be exercised in the face of a foreign occupier purporting to appropriate territory for itself and thereby dispossess the Palestinian people.\n\nThe third key aspect is that the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate the law of occupation.\n\nThe indisputable starting-point is that, as an occupying power, Israel is bound to respect, throughout the occupied territory, its obligations under international humanitarian law, a régime designed to ensure the protection of the people under occupation.\n\nThe Maldives agrees that the continuing applicability of international humanitarian law is without prejudice to the unlawfulness of Israel’s occupation.\n\nNow, many examples of international humanitarian law breaches have been cited before the Court, including with respect to Israel’s settlement policy as a breach of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel’s policies and practices with respect to water resources constitute a cascade of further violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 1907 Hague Regulations, notably:\n\nIsrael’s conduct is a violation of the rules prohibiting destruction of property, which includes water and sanitation infrastructure, in circumstances where it is clearly not “absolutely necessary” for military operations.\n\nIt is a violation of the prohibition on destruction or removal of objects essential for survival of the civilian population, with water installations and supplies obviously qualifying as such.\n\nIt is a violation of the prohibition on pillage, as well as the rules of usufruct.\n\nIt is also a violation of the obligation to ensure and maintain public health and hygiene in territory it occupies. This goes to a point of grave practical concern a raft of horrific diseases spring directly from the lack of clean water, with little children particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe fourth and final key aspect is that Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Territory are in violation of international human rights law, including the fundamental jus cogens prohibition of discrimination.\n\nThe irrefutable starting-point: this is that Israel bears a duty to secure respect for the applicable rules of international human rights law throughout the territory that it occupies.\n\nInternational human rights law encompasses the right to water. Notably:\n\nThat right emanates from Articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. As the General Assembly affirmed in 2016, “the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living are essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights”.\n\nFurther, as a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Israel has expressly undertaken to pursue “full implementation” of each child’s rights to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including through the provision of clean drinking water.\n\nEqually clearly, international human rights law prohibits discrimination. Notably, pursuant to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Israel is obliged to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, national or ethnic origin, to the enjoyment of rights, which include a right to water.\n\nYet Israel’s discriminatory policies and practices with respect to access to water have been well documented and condemned by a deluge of United Nations bodies, with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination “appalled at the hermetic character of the separation of the two groups [Jewish communities in illegal settlements on the one hand and Palestinian populations on the other hand] who do not enjoy equal access to water resources”.\n\nThe impact on women and children is notably egregious, with the dearth of clean water an acute crisis for mothers trying to feed their babies.\n\nIsrael’s policy and practices relating to water are but one among many examples of systematic discrimination which have been detailed by other States in these proceedings.\n\nThe Maldives joins the plethora of other States in confirming before this Court that the régime which Israel has established throughout the occupied territory constitutes apartheid, pursuant to the customary international law definition as reflected in Article II of the Apartheid Convention.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, at a human level, Israel’s policies and practices with regard to water resources are inexcusably intensifying the hardship being endured by the Palestinian people and exemplify the illegality which has characterized Israel’s occupation. The final speech for the Maldives will address how the Court should answer the questions posed by the General Assembly in light of Israel’s breaches of international law."

And that is unsurprising because the relevant principles are well established in the customary international law rules on State responsibility and the Court’s jurisprudence.\n\nFirst, Israel is obliged to cease its continuing unlawful acts. This includes, of course, an obligation to terminate its occupation, just as South Africa was obliged to withdraw from Namibia where its presence was illegal. The Court there specifically stated that withdrawal must occur “immediately”. Here, the General Assembly has recently stressed “the urgency of achieving without delay an end to the Israeli occupation”.\n\nBut that is not all. Israel must also cease the discrete unlawful practices which have characterized its occupation. For example, it must dismantle the discriminatory régime concerning water resources referred to in Ms Sander’s speech, in precisely the same way as the Court previously stated that Israel must dismantle both the wall and the associated legislative and regulatory régime which entrenched discrimination77.\n\nSecondly, at the same time as terminating its unlawful acts, Israel must provide assurances that it will not repeat them."

And, to the extent that compensation will not fully make good the harms caused, Israel must provide just satisfaction in other forms, such as acknowledging its breaches and providing formal apologies.\n\nFourth, there are obligations on third States. States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention must search for individuals accused of committing or ordering grave breaches of that instrument, including the rules of occupation, and prosecute or extradite them. Further consequences flow from the occupation’s unlawful status, and I will deal with those in relation to the second question."

        "texto": "In question, the General Assembly asked the Court how Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory affect the legal status of the occupation, and what legal consequences arise for all States and the United Nations.\n\nMs Sander has addressed the many illegal aspects of Israel’s occupation. Each and every one of Israel’s unlawful acts engages its responsibility as a State. But what is it that determines the status of the occupation? The factors affecting status are those that go beyond illegality in the conduct of the arbitration and that make the occupation irremediable, meaning that the occupation is what the Court described in the Namibia Opinion as “a situation which is maintained in violation of international law”. In other words, it is those breaches of international law that cannot be cured within the occupation, but only by the occupation coming to an end, that render it unlawful as a matter of status.\n\nOne such matter is the permanence of Israel’s occupation — notably the fait accompli that this Court warned about in its Wall Opinion. Israel has sought to “create irreversible facts on the ground”. As Ms Sander has highlighted, by installing itself as an interminable presence, Israel has violated the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force. The Court need not decide whether Israel’s occupation was unlawful ab initio; its wrongfulness can be established even if one looks only at the fact of its prolonged continuation with no end in contemplation. The wrongful permanence of Israel’s presence — that breach of a peremptory norm of international law — cannot be corrected for as long as Israel remains in the occupied territory at all. That is why it goes to the occupation’s status.\n\nThe same is true when it comes to Israel’s breaches of the right to self-determination. For example, that right encompasses an entitlement to territorial integrity. Whether or not the territory is within internationally recognized borders, contrary to what you have been told this afternoon. It is inherent in Israel’s ongoing occupation that it dispossesses Palestinians of their territory and that it divides the territory: recall the “fragmented archipelago” that Ms Sander referred to. Israel’s presence and the Palestinian people’s right to territorial integrity are mutually exclusive. And again, this is determinative of the occupation’s status.\n\nWhat are the legal consequences of this analysis? For Israel, they include those I have already addressed in relation to question, starting with a duty immediately to terminate the occupation in its entirety. Given the occupation’s unlawful status, Israel simply cannot achieve compliance with international law as long as it remains in occupation. As well, Israel’s ongoing presence cannot produce any effects as a matter of international law, and in particular cannot change the status of any occupied territory.\n\nHowever, as Ms Sander has alluded to, it is not a consequence of the occupation’s status that Israel can somehow escape obligations concerning the conduct of an occupation. To the contrary, pending its urgent withdrawal, Israel remains bound by rules of international humanitarian law. Those rules apply whenever an occupation exists in fact, lawful or not — and, as the Court has stated, “regardless of the status of the occupied territories”. The same is true of Israel’s obligations under international human rights law. Those duties are engaged based on Israel’s exercise of jurisdiction — again, a purely factual state of affairs.\n\nThe conduct of third States and the United Nations is likely to be of critical practical importance in leading Israel to end its unlawful actions. The people of Palestine, like the people of Namibia half a century ago, should be able to “look to the international community for assistance” in realising their rights.\n\nIn light of Israel’s gross and systematic breaches of jus cogens norms, third States bear certain negative duties articulated in the Court’s previous advisory opinions. They must not recognize the situation created by Israel’s occupation as lawful or lend that occupation any support or assistance. Accordingly, they must avoid acts which could imply such recognition, such as engaging in trade or any “other forms of relationship” with Israel which may “entrench” its position. They also must not enter into or maintain treaty relations in which Israel purports to act on behalf of or concerning that territory, except treaties of a humanitarian character. Third States must not send diplomatic or special missions to Israel with a remit extending to the occupied territory, as if that territory were simply part of Israel. A third State which does not uphold these duties may encounter consequences in its own relations with other States. According to the Court in Namibia, “no State which enters into relations with South Africa concerning Namibia may expect the United Nations or its Members to recognize the validity or effects of such relationship”. The same applies here.\n\nEqually, third States bear certain positive duties: an obligation to co-operate, including through the United Nations, to complete Israel’s extraction from the occupied territory; a duty to remove any impediments to the Palestinian people’s exercise of the right to self-determination; and a duty to ensure Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law.\n\nAs for the United Nations, all of its component parts, but especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should “consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation”. In 2004, the Court urged the United Nations, as a matter of “urgent necessity”, to “redouble its efforts to bring the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a speedy conclusion”. That urgency has not abated; it has intensified. How the Court advises the General Assembly on this occasion will, it is to be hoped, help to illuminate the path forward for the entire United Nations system."

        "texto": "Mr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the International Law Commission, in the report of its seventy-third session, has referred to the basic rules of international humanitarian law as having the status of a peremptory norm of general international law (ius cogens), with the legal consequences that that status may entail.\n\nThe provisions of the Hague Regulations, annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which Israel is not a party, have become nevertheless part of customary international law. Particularly pertinent in the present case is Section III of those Regulations, which concerns “Military authority over the territory of the hostile State”. Furthermore, the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party, is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict and, as the Court has assessed, it is applicable to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem.\n\nRegarding Israeli settlements, Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that “[t]he Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. It prohibits also any measure taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfer of parts of its own population into the occupied territory. Since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories which are in contravention of the aforementioned Article 49, paragraph 6. Therefore, the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution, as stated repeatedly by relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The establishment of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories is tending to alter the demographic composition of that territory, contributing to demographic changes, all in contravention of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nThe practice of demolitions results in the forcible transfer or forced eviction of Palestinians and impedes a de facto return of Palestinian families and communities to their original dwellings, all in contravention of international humanitarian law.\n\nFurthermore, in 2004 the Court considered that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a “fait accompli” on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case it would be tantamount to a de facto annexation, as well as a contribution to further alterations of the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nArticles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention remain applicable to the occupied Palestinian territories and are to be taken into account in this case.\nSpain is of the view that neither Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, nor the state of necessity, have any relevance in this case in order to preclude the wrongfulness of those actions."

        "texto": "Mr President, distinguished Members of the Court, both Israel and Palestine are under the obligation to observe the rules of international law.\n\nProhibition of the use of force, illegal territorial acquisition and principle of self-determination\n\nIn the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories that had constituted Palestine under the British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank) located east of the Green Line. This occupation was immediately and unanimously condemned by Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which underlined that “all Member States, in accepting the Charter of the United Nations, have undertaken to act in accordance with Article 2 of the Charter”.\n\nThe principle of prohibition of the use of armed force is one of the fundamental principles of international law and, as formulated in General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), is accompanied by the following corollary: “No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”. The Court, which has on several occasions affirmed the importance of this principle has not hesitated to apply this principle to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. In the Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (2004), the Court has recalled the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. The Court concluded: “Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of an occupying Power”.\n\nFinally, the Court added: “Subsequent events in these territories have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power”. Although Israel finally withdrew its civilian and military presence from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it has maintained full control of its borders, coastline and airspace ever since. Consequently, as the Security Council has affirmed, the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967.\n\nThe Court concluded that Israel’s settlement policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the measures taken with regard to Jerusalem and the construction of the wall have been established in violation of international law, not only because they are contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention, but also because they prevent the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination. In its construction, the Court points out that the wall, the temporary nature of which is open to doubt, is accompanied by a regulatory régime aimed at annexing the occupied territories. This aim constitutes a serious violation of the rules of international humanitarian law incumbent upon Israel as the occupying Power, has the effect of violating the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, and the human rights of the inhabitants of these territories. These statements are also applicable to the Gaza Strip. Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 has not meant that the occupation of the territory came to an end, as Israel has retained effective control over the territory through its control of airspace, territorial sea and external land boundaries.\n\nThe extensive documentation submitted to this advisory procedure demonstrates that, 20 years after the Court’s Opinion, Israel continues to implement its policies, prolonging the very serious violations of international law found by the Court.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, on 3 October 1991, Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. As stated by the Court, the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict.\n\nRegarding the territorial scope of those instruments, they are applicable in respect of acts executed by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory, that is, that they apply both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction.\n\nThose elements concur in this case; therefore, Spain considers that those instruments are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nAs stated by the Court in its Advisory Opinion of 2004, the territories occupied by Israel have been now, for over 50 years, subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of human rights law and, furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.\n\nHaving determined the applicability of human rights law within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, it is time to seek whether Israeli policies and practices referred to in paragraph 18 of General Assembly resolution 77/247 have violated those rules and, therefore, have infringed the human rights of Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel. Among those rights that are being violated are those of Articles 17 and 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nAlso, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 has underlined in her latest report to the Human Rights Council that Israeli forces often detain individuals without charge or trial, in what has been denominated “administrative detention”. Administrative detention is permissible only under very strict circumstances and must always be carried out in line with the protection afforded under international law.\n\nPalestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories are subject to a system of jurisdictional fragmentation in the context of a structure of institutionalized discrimination. Israeli military courts enforce military law upon Palestinians, while Israeli courts apply Israeli civil law to Israelis, including settlers.\n\nRegarding the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, there are several provisions affected by Israel’s policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories, for example: the right to work (Articles 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Article 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right “to be free from hunger” (Article 11); the right to health (Article 12) and the right to education (Articles 13 and 14). Similar provisions can be found in Articles 14, 16, 27 and 28 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nState parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, according to its Article 2, shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in it to each child within their jurisdiction. Of particular concern are the detention, interrogation, prosecution and imprisonment of numerous Palestinian children by Israeli occupation forces, practice that is contrary to Article 37 of that Convention.\n\nCertain policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories impose restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the occupied Palestinian territories, and deprive a significant number of Palestinians of their freedom to choose their residence and have, as well, repercussions for agricultural production, through the confiscation and destruction of agricultural assets. On the other hand, the population of the occupied Palestinian territories is experiencing increasing difficulties regarding access to health services, educational facilities and sources of water, impeding the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to health, to education, to water, to sanitation and to an adequate standard of living. All these difficulties and restrictions infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel which cannot be justified neither by military exigencies, nor by the requirements of national security or public order.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, what are the legal consequences arising from the repeated, permanent and aggravated non-compliance of core rules of international law? This is the question the General Assembly requested to the Court. When this question is examined from the perspective of the law of State responsibility, the importance of the advisory opinion becomes critical.\n\nArticles 40 and 41 of the 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts answer this question.\nAccording to these Articles, a serious breach of an obligation established for the protection of the interests of the international community as a whole entails the legal consequences stipulated for all breaches of international law and some particular consequences.\nTherefore, the responsible State is obliged to cease the wrongful act, to give, if appropriate, guarantees and assurances of non-repetition, and to make reparation.\nMoreover, the responsible State is bound to continue performance of the international obligation.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to comply with international obligations gives also rise to the right for the injured State to seek redress or take countermeasures.\nHowever, it has been said, Article 41 states that, besides these “ordinary” consequences, serious breaches of ius cogens rules gives rise to some additional particular consequences, which, generally speaking, imply certain obligations for all other States to respond to the wrongful act: namely obligation to co-operate with and bring to an end the alleged violation, obligation not to recognize the illegal situation and obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation.\n\nMr President, my intervention will focus on these particular obligations of all States (other than the injured State). In its 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Wall, the Court briefly referred to these additional consequences.\n\nTwenty years later, with the worsening of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court is called upon to set out in greater detail these obligations.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the duty to co-operate to bring to an end remains the first obligation of States, according to Article 41 of the Draft Articles. This obligation to co-operate shall be carried out by all States.\nIn the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, co-operation among all States has been organized in the framework of the United Nations.\nOnce again, 20 years after the Advisory Opinion on the Wall was passed, it is an indisputable reality that the situation in Palestine has worsened; and that resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have repeatedly condemned the actions of the parties and repeatedly demanded the cessation of the violations of international law. However, such resolutions have failed to establish redress and sanction measures.\n\nTherefore, the reference of Article 41 to the action of all States becomes critical. In some way paragraph 159 of the Advisory Opinion on the Wall underlines this when this paragraph establishes that “it is also for all States” to take measures to end the breach. Moreover, in the comments to Conclusion 19 of the Draft conclusions on identification and legal consequences of peremptory norms of general international law (ius cogens), we can read that this statement suggests “that, over and above collective action, there is an obligation on individual States to make efforts to bring situations created by the breach to an end”.\n\nIn the current circumstances, maybe the Court could determine what such an obligation to co-operate might consist of in this case.\nIn doing so, the Court may take into consideration the numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, especially those resolutions stating that States are obliged not to take measures that would imply changes in the status of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The corollary is clear: “establishing diplomatic missions in the Holy City” is a serious threat to the stability of peace in the region and the world.\n\nComing back to the co-operation of all States within the bodies of the United Nations, the Court could determine whether the obligation of all States to co-operate to bring to an end any serious violations of peremptory norms entails, within the Security Council in particular, the duty to not prevent, hinder or delay collective action in favour of the peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n6. Mr President, let me move on now to consider the two particular duties included in Article 41, paragraph 2, of the 2001 Draft Articles: namely the duty not to recognize the illegal situation and the duty not to render aid or assistance in maintaining this situation.\n\nWhat situation?\n\nThe last resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict update the scope of the current situation that should not be legally recognized.\nCertainly, resolution 74/88 of the General Assembly, the first one including this formula, “[c]alls upon all States... not to recognize, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining, the situation created by measures that are illegal under international law, including those aimed at advancing annexation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.\nSince these two obligations have been reiterated by the Court and other United Nations bodies in this, but also in other situations, they are to be considered as customary law (something that by the way the International Law Commission has already affirmed).\n\nFinally, let me, Mr President, refer briefly to paragraph 3 of Article 41 of the Draft Articles, which states that international law may recognize additional legal consequences deriving from the legal régime to which the primary rule that has been violated belongs.\nThese particular obligations can be found either in the foundation of the legal régime particular or in Security Council resolutions.\n\nArticles 47 and 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention are good examples of obligations provided for in the foundational treaties of a concrete, a particular legal régime, like international humanitarian law. While Article 47 establishes the inviolability of the rights of persons in occupied territories, Article 146 refers to the obligation of the States parties to the Convention to prosecute and condemn persons who commit or order to be committed any of the grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThat said, these obligations linked to a particular legal régime sometimes are specified by the Security Council itself. This is the case of resolution 2334 (2016) which requires a State to distinguish in their relevant dealings between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, Spain formulates these considerations within the framework of a consultative procedure, aware that the Court  guardian of international legality can offer the United Nations arguments to adopt decisions to address the situation and, at the same time, contribute to the clarification and development of the international legal order."

Since these two obligations have been reiterated by the Court and other United Nations bodies in this, but also in other situations, they are to be considered as customary law (something that by the way the International Law Commission has already affirmed).\n\nFinally, let me, Mr President, refer briefly to paragraph 3 of Article 41 of the Draft Articles, which states that international law may recognize additional legal consequences deriving from the legal régime to which the primary rule that has been violated belongs.

While Article 47 establishes the inviolability of the rights of persons in occupied territories, Article 146 refers to the obligation of the States parties to the Convention to prosecute and condemn persons who commit or order to be committed any of the grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThat said, these obligations linked to a particular legal régime sometimes are specified by the Security Council itself. This is the case of resolution 2334 (2016) which requires a State to distinguish in their relevant dealings between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, Spain formulates these considerations within the framework of a consultative procedure, aware that the Court guardian of international legality can offer the United Nations arguments to adopt decisions to address the situation and, at the same time, contribute to the clarification and development of the international legal order."

        "texto": "Mr President, distinguished Members of the Court, what are the legal consequences arising from the repeated, permanent and aggravated non-compliance of core rules of international law? This is the question the General Assembly requested to the Court. When this question is examined from the perspective of the law of State responsibility, the importance of the advisory opinion becomes critical.\n\nArticles 40 and 41 of the 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts answer this question. According to these Articles, a serious breach of an obligation established for the protection of the interests of the international community as a whole entails the legal consequences stipulated for all breaches of international law and some particular consequences. Therefore, the responsible State is obliged to cease the wrongful act, to give, if appropriate, guarantees and assurances of non-repetition, and to make reparation. Moreover, the responsible State is bound to continue performance of the international obligation.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to comply with international obligations gives also rise to the right for the injured State to seek redress or take countermeasures. However, it has been said, Article 41 states that, besides these “ordinary” consequences, serious breaches of ius cogens rules gives rise to some additional particular consequences, which, generally speaking, imply certain obligations for all other States to respond to the wrongful act: namely obligation to co-operate with and bring to an end the alleged violation, obligation not to recognize the illegal situation and obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation.\n\nMr President, my intervention will focus on these particular obligations of all States (other than the injured State). In its 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Wall, the Court briefly referred to these additional consequences.\n\nTwenty years later, with the worsening of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court is called upon to set out in greater detail these obligations.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the duty to co-operate to bring to an end remains the first obligation of States, according to Article 41 of the Draft Articles. This obligation to co-operate shall be carried out by all States. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, co-operation among all States has been organized in the framework of the United Nations. Once again, 20 years after the Advisory Opinion on the Wall was passed, it is an indisputable reality that the situation in Palestine has worsened; and that resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have repeatedly condemned the actions of the parties and repeatedly demanded the cessation of the violations of international law. However, such resolutions have failed to establish redress and sanction measures.\n\nTherefore, the reference of Article 41 to the action of all States becomes critical. In some way paragraph 159 of the Advisory Opinion on the Wall underlines this when this paragraph establishes that “it is also for all States” to take measures to end the breach. Moreover, in the comments to Conclusion 19 of the Draft conclusions on identification and legal consequences of peremptory norms of general international law (ius cogens), we can read that this statement suggests “that, over and above collective action, there is an obligation on individual States to make efforts to bring situations created by the breach to an end”.\n\nIn the current circumstances, maybe the Court could determine what such an obligation to co-operate might consist of in this case. In doing so, the Court may take into consideration the numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, especially those resolutions stating that States are obliged not to take measures that would imply changes in the status of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The corollary is clear: “establishing diplomatic missions in the Holy City” is a serious threat to the stability of peace in the region and the world.\n\nComing back to the co-operation of all States within the bodies of the United Nations, the Court could determine whether the obligation of all States to co-operate to bring to an end any serious violations of peremptory norms entails, within the Security Council in particular, the duty to not prevent, hinder or delay collective action in favour of the peaceful resolution of the conflict. 6. Mr President, let me move on now to consider the two particular duties included in Article 41, paragraph 2, of the 2001 Draft Articles: namely the duty not to recognize the illegal situation and the duty not to render aid or assistance in maintaining this situation.\n\nWhat situation?\n\nThe last resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict update the scope of the current situation that should not be legally recognized. Certainly, resolution 74/88 of the General Assembly, the first one including this formula, “[c]alls upon all States... not to recognize, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining, the situation created by measures that are illegal under international law, including those aimed at advancing annexation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”. Since these two obligations have been reiterated by the Court and other United Nations bodies in this, but also in other situations, they are to be considered as customary law (something that by the way the International Law Commission has already affirmed).\n\nFinally, let me, Mr President, refer briefly to paragraph 3 of Article 41 of the Draft Articles, which states that international law may recognize additional legal consequences deriving from the legal régime to which the primary rule that has been violated belongs. These particular obligations can be found either in the foundation of the legal régime particular or in Security Council resolutions.\n\nArticles 47 and 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention are good examples of obligations provided for in the foundational treaties of a concrete, a particular legal régime, like international humanitarian law. While Article 47 establishes the inviolability of the rights of persons in occupied territories, Article 146 refers to the obligation of the States parties to the Convention to prosecute and condemn persons who commit or order to be committed any of the grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThat said, these obligations linked to a particular legal régime sometimes are specified by the Security Council itself. This is the case of resolution 2334 (2016) which requires a State to distinguish in their relevant dealings between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, Spain formulates these considerations within the framework of a consultative procedure, aware that the Court  guardian of international legality can offer the United Nations arguments to adopt decisions to address the situation and, at the same time, contribute to the clarification and development of the international legal order."
