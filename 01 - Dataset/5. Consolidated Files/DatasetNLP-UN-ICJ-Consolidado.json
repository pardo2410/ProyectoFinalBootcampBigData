  "texto": "Question: Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested. /n/n13. When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

When seised of a request for an advisory opinion, the Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and whether, should the answer be in the affirmative, there is any reason why it should decline to exercise any such jurisdiction (see Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (1), p. 232, para. 10).\n\n14. The Court will thus first address the question whether it possesses jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003. The competence of the Court in this regard is based on Article 65, paragraph l, of its Statute, according to which the Court, according to which the Court \"may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request\". The Court has already had occasion to indicate that: \"It is ... a precondition of the Court's competence that the advisory opinion be requested by an organ duly authorized to seek it under the Charter, that it be requested on a legal question, and that, except in the case of the General Assembly or the Security Council, that question should be one arising within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ.\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982, pp. 333-334, para. 21.)\n\n15. It is for the Court to satisfy itself that the request for an advisory opinion comes from an organ or agency having competence to make it. In the present instance, the Court notes that the General Assembly, which seeks the advisory opinion, is authorized to do so by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which provides: \"The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\"\n\n16. Although the above-mentioned provision states that the General Assembly may seek an advisory opinion \"on any legal question\", the Court has sometimes in the past given certain indications as to the relationship between the question the subject of a request for an advisory opinion and the activities of the General Assembly (Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 70; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 232 and 233, paras. 11 and 12).\n\n17. The Court will so proceed in the present case. The Court would observe that Article 10 of the Charter has conferred upon the General Assembly a competence relating to \"any questions or any matters\" within the scope of the Charter, and that Article 11, paragraph 2, has specifically provided it with competence on \"questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations . . .\" and to make recommendations under certain conditions fixed by those: Articles. As will be explained below, the question of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was brought before the General Assembly by a number of Member States in the context of the 1Tenth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly, convened to deal with what the Assembly, in its resolution ES-1012 of 25 April 1997, considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\n18. Before further examining the problems of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings, the Court considers it necessary to describe the events that led to the adoption of resolution ES-10114, by which the General assembly requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n19. The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, at which that resolution was adopted, was first convened following the rejection by the Security Council, on 7 March and 21 March 1997, as a result of negative votes by a permanent member, of two draft resolutions concerning certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see, respectively, SI19971199 and SIPV.3747, and SI19971241 and SlPV.3756). By a letter of 31 March 1997, the Chairman of the Arab Group then requested \"that an emergency special session of the General Assembly be convened pursuant to resolution 377 A (V) entitled 'Uniting for Peace' \" with a view to discussing \"Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (letter dated 31 March 199'7 from the Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, AIES-1011, 22 April 1997, Annex). The majority of Members of the United Nations having concurred in this request, the first meeting of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly took place on 24 April 1997 (see AIES-1011, 22 April 1997). Resolution ES-1012 was adopted the following day; the General Assembly thereby expressed its conviction that: \"the repeated violation by Israel, the occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a threat to international peace and security\", and condemned the \"illegal Israeli actions\" in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the construction of settlements in that territory. The Tenth Emergency Special Session was then adjourned temporarily and has since been reconvened 11 times (on 15 July 1997, 13 November 1997, 17 March 1998, 5 February 1999, 18 October 2000, 20 December 2001, 7 May 2002, 5 August 2002, 19 September 2003, 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003).\n\n20. By a letter dated 9 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested an immediate meeting of the Security Council to consider the \"grave and ongoing Israeli violations of international law, including international humanitarian law, and to take the necessary measures in this regard\" (letter ol-9 October 2003 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations to the President of the Security Council. Sl20031973, 9 October 2003). This letter was accompanied by a draft resolution for consideration by the Council, which condemned as illegal the construction by Israel of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory departing from the Armistice Line of 1949. The Security Council held its 4841 st and 4842nd meetings on 14 October 2003 to consider the item entitled \"The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestine question\". It then had before it another draft resolution proposed on the same day by Guinea, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, which also condemned the construction of the wall. This latter draft resolution was put to a vote after an open debate and was not adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council (SlPV.484 1 and SlPV.4842).\n\nOn 15 October 2003, the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, requested the resumption of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to consider the item of \"Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" (AIES-101242); this request was supported by the Non-Aligned Movement (AIES-101243) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Group at the United Nations (AIES-101244). The Tenth Emergency Special Session resumed its work on 20 October 2003.\n\n21. On 27 October 2003, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES - 10/13, by which it demanded that\n\n\"Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is\nin departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to\nrelevant provisions of international law\" (p ara. l).\n\nIn paragraph 3, the Assembly requested the Secretary -General\n\"to report on compliance with the .  resolution periodically, with the\nfirst report on compliance with paragraph I [of that resolution] to be\nsubmitted within one month ...\".\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session was temporarily adjourned and, on 24\nNovember 2003, the report of the Secretary -General prepared pursuant to\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES -10/13 (hereinafter the \"report of the\nSecretary -General\") was issued (A/ES -10/24 8).\n\n22. Meanwhile, on 19 November 2003, the Security Council adopted resolution 1515 (2003), by which it \"Endorse[d] the Quartet Performance - based Roadmap to a Permanent Two - State Solution to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict\". The Quartet consists of representatives of the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. That resolution\n\n\"Call[ed] on the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Roadmap\nin cooperation with the Quartet and to achieve the vision of two States\nliving side by side in peace and security.\"\n\nNeither the \"Roadmap\" nor resolution 1515 (2003) contained any specific\nprovision concerning the construction of the wall, which was not discussed\nby the Security Council in this context.\n\n23. Nineteen days later, on 8 December 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly again resumed its work, following a new request by the Chairman of the Arab Group, on behalf of the States Members of the League of Arab States, and pursuant to resolution ES -10/13 (letter dated 1 December 2003 to the President of the General Assembly from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait to the United Nations, A/ES -10/249, 2 December 2003). It was during the meeting convened on that day that resolution ES - 10/14 requesting the present advisory opinion was adopted.\n\n24. Having thus recalled the sequence of events that led to the adoption of resolution ES - 10/14, the Court will now turn to the questions of jurisdiction that have been raised in the present proceedings. First, Israel has alleged that, given the active engagement of the Security Council with the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the General Assembly acted ultra vires under the Charter when it requested an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n25. The Court has already indicated that the subject of the present request for an advisory opinion falls within the competence of the General Assembly under the Charter (see paragraphs 15 -17 above). However, Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter provides that:\n\n\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\"\n\nA request for an advisory opinion is not in itself a \"recommendation\" by the General Assembly \"with regard to [a] dispute or situation\". It has however been argued in this case that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14 was ultra vires as not in accordance with Article 12. The Court thus considers that it is appropriate for it to examine the significance of that Article, having regard to the relevant texts and the practice of the United Nations.\n\n26. Under Article 24 of the Charter the Security Council has \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\". In that regard, it can impose on States \"an explicit obligation of compliance if, for example, it issues an order or command... under Chapter VII\" and can, to that end, \"require enforcement by coercive action\" (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). However, the Court would emphasize that Article 24 refers to a primary, but not necessarily exclusive, competence. The General Assembly does have the power, inter alia, under Article 14 of the Charter, to \"recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment\" of various situations (ibid.).\n\n\"[T]he only limitation which Article 14 imposes on the (General Assembly is the restriction found in Article 12, namely, that the Assembly should not recommend measures while the Security Council is dealing with the same matter unless the Council requests it to do so.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163.)\n\n27. As regards the practice of the United Nations, both the General Assembly and the Security Council initially interpreted and applied Article 12 to the effect that the Assembly could not make a recommendation on a question concerning the maintenance of international peace and security while the matter remained on the Council's agenda. Thus, the Assembly during its fourth session refused to recommend certain measures on the question of Indonesia, on the ground, inter alia, that the Council remained seized of the matter (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fourth Session, Ad Hoc Political Committee, Summary Records of Meetings, 27 September - 7 December 1949, 56th Meeting, 3 December 1949, p. 339, para. 118). As for the Council, on a number of occasions, it deleted items from its agenda in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on them (for example, in respect of the Spanish question (Official Records of the Security Council, First Year: Second Series, No. 21, 79th Meeting, 4 November 1946, p. 498), in connection with incidents on the Greek border (Official Records of the Security Council, Second Year, No. 89, 202nd Meeting, 15 September 1947, pp. 2404 - 2405), and in regard to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) (Official Records of the Security Council, Fifth Year, No. 48, 506th Meeting, 29 September 1950, p. 5)). In the case of the Republic of Korea, the Council decided on 31 January 1951 to remove the relevant item from the list of matters of which it was seized in order to enable the Assembly to deliberate on the matter (Official Records of the Security Council, Sixth Year, S/PV.531, 531st Meeting, 31 January 1951, pp. 11 - 12, para. 57).\n\nHowever, this interpretation of Article 12 has evolved subsequently. Thus, the General Assembly deemed itself entitled in 1961 to adopt recommendations in the matter of the Congo (resolutions 1955 (XV) and 1600 (XVI)) and in 1963 in respect of the Portuguese colonies (resolution 1913 (XVIII)) while those cases still appeared on the Council's agenda, without the Council having adopted any recent resolution concerning them. In response to a question posed by Peru during the twenty-third session of the General Assembly, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations confirmed that the Assembly interpreted the words \"is exercising the functions\" in Article 12 of the Charter as meaning \"is exercising the functions at this moment\" (General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Third Committee, 1637th meeting, A/C.3/SR.1637, para. 9). Indeed, the Court notes that there has been an increasing tendency over time for the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security (see, for example, the matters involving Cyprus, South Africa, Angola, Southern Rhodesia and more recently Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia). It is often the case that, while the Security Council has tended to focus on the aspects of such matters related to international peace and security, the General Assembly has taken a broader view, considering also their humanitarian, social, and economic aspects.\n\n28. The Court considers that the accepted practice of the General Assembly, as it has evolved, is consistent with Article 12, paragraph l, of the Charter. The Court is accordingly of the view that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution ES - 10/14, seeking an advisory opinion from the Court, did not \"contravene the provisions of Article 12, paragraph l , of the Charter. The Court concludes that by submitting that request the General Assembly did not exceed its competence.\n\n29. It has however been contended before the Court that the present request for an advisory opinion did not fulfill the essential conditions set by resolution 377 A (V), under which the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened and has continued to act. In this regard, it has been said, first, that \"The Security Council was never seised of a draft resolution proposing that the Council itself should request an advisory opinion from the Court on the matters now in contention\", and, that specific issue having thus never been brought before the Council, the General Assembly could not rely on any inaction by the Council to make such a request. Secondly, it has been claimed that, in adopting resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the \"Roadmap\", before the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution ES - 10/14, the Security Council continued to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and that, as a result, the General Assembly was not entitled to act in its place. The validity of the procedure followed by the Tenth Emergency Special Session, especially the Session's \"rolling character\" and the fact that its meeting was convened to deliberate on the request for the advisory opinion at the same time as the General Assembly was meeting in regular session, has also been questioned. 
  \n\n30. The Court would recall that resolution 377 A (V) states that:\n\n\"if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures ... \".\n\nThe procedure provided for by that resolution is premised on two conditions, namely that the Council has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of a negative vote of one or more permanent members, and that the situation is one in which there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether these conditions were fulfilled as regards the convening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, in particular at the time when the Assembly decided to request an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\n31. In the light of the sequence of events described in paragraphs 18 to 23 above, the Court observes that, at the time when the Tenth Emergency Special Session was convened in 1997, the Council had been unable to take a decision on the case of certain Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, due to negative votes of a permanent member; and that, as indicated in resolution ES -10/2 (see paragraph 19 above), there existed a threat to international peace and security. The Court further notes that, on 20 October 2003, the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was reconvened on the same basis as in 1997 (see the statements by the representatives of Palestine and Israel, A/ES -10/PV .21, pp. 2 and 5), after  the rejection by the Security Council, on 14 October 2003, again as a result of the negative vote of a permanent member, of a draft resolution concerning the construction by Israel of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court considers that the Security Council again failed to act as contemplated in resolution 377 A (V). It does not appear to the Court that the situation in this regard changed between 20 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, since the Council neither discussed the construction of the wall nor adopted any resolution in that connection. Thus, the Court is of the view that, up to 8 December 2003, the Council had not reconsidered the negative vote of 14 October 2003. It follows that, during that period, the Tenth Emergency Special Session was duly reconvened and could properly be seised, under resolution 377 A (V), of the matter now before the Court.\n\n32. The Court would also emphasize that, in the course of this Emergency Special Session, the General Assembly could adopt any resolution falling within the subject -matter for which the Session had been convened, and otherwise within its powers, including a re solution seeking the Court's opinion. It is irrelevant in that regard that no proposal had been made to the Security Council to request such an opinion.\n\n33. Turning now to alleged further procedural irregularities of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, the Court does not consider that the \"rolling\" character of that Session, namely the fact of its having been convened in April 1997 and reconvened 11 times since then, has any relevance with regard to the validity of the request by the General Assembly. The Court observes in that regard that the Seventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, having been convened on 22 July 198(), was subsequently reconvened four times (on 2() April 1982, 25 June 1982, 16 August 1982 and 24 September 1982), and that the validity of resolutions or decisions of the Assembly adopted under such circumstances was never disputed. Nor has the validity of any previous resolutions adopted during the Tenth Emergency Special Session been challenged.\n\n34. The Court also notes the contention by Israel that it was improper to reconvene the Tenth Emergency Special Session at a time when the regular session of the General Assembly was in progress. The Court considers that, while it may not have been originally contemplated that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to hold simultaneous emergency and regular sessions, no rule of the Organization has been identified which would be thereby violated, so as to render invalid the resolution adopting the present request for an advisory opinion.\n\n35. Finally, the Tenth Emergency Special Session appears to have been convened in accordance with Rule 9 (b) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, and the relevant meetings have been convened in pursuance of the applicable rules. As the Court stat ed in its Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 concerning the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), a \"resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organ's rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted\" (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 22, para. 20).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court cannot see any reason why that presumption is to be rebutted in the present case.\n\n36. The Court now turns to a further issue related to jurisdiction in the present proceedings., namely the contention that the request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly is not on a \"legal question\" within the meaning of Article 96, paragraph l, o f the Charter and Article 65, paragraph l, of the Statute of the Court. It has been contended in this regard that, for a question to constitute a \"legal question\" for the purposes of these two provisions, it must be reasonably specific, since otherwise it would not be amenable to a response by the Court. With regard to the request made in the present advisory proceedings, it has been argued that it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty the legal meaning of the question asked of the Court fo r two reasons.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the question regarding the \"legal consequences\" of the construction of the wall only allows for two possible interpretations, each of which would lead to a course of action that is precluded for the Court. The question asked could first be interpreted as a request for the Court to find that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then to give its opinion on the legal consequences of that illegality. In this case, it has been con tended, the Court should decline to respond to the question asked for a variety of reasons, some of which pertain to jurisdiction and others rather to the issue of propriety. As regards jurisdiction, it is said that, if the General Assembly had wished to obtain the view of the Court on the highly complex and sensitive question of the legality of the construction of the wall, it should have expressly sought an opinion to that effect (cf. Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations, Advisory Opinion, 1925, P. C .I. J. , Series B, No. 10, p. 17). A second possible interpretation of the request, it is said, is that the Court should assume that the construction of the wall is illegal, and then give its opinion on the legal consequences of that assumed illegality. It  has been contended that the Court should also decline to respond to the question on this hypothesis, since the request would then be based on a questionable assumption and since, in any event, it would be impossible to rule on the legal consequences of il legality without specifying the nature of that illegality.\n\nSecondly, it has been contended that the question asked of the Court is not of a \"legal\" character because of its imprecision and abstract nature. In particular, it has been argued in this regard that the question fails to specify whether the Court is bein g asked to address legal consequences for \"the General Assembly or some other organ of the United Nations\", \"Member States of the United Nations\", Israel\", \"Palestine\" or \"some combination of the above, or some different entity\".\n\n37. As regards the alleged lack of clarity of the terms of the General Assembly's request and its effect on the \"legal nature\" of the question referred to the Court, the Court observes that this question is directed to the legal consequences arising from a given factual situation considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (hereinafter the \"Fourth Geneva Convention\") and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The question submitted by the General Assembly has thus, to use the Court's phrase in its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, \"been framed in terms of law and raise[s] problems of international law\"; it is by it s very nature susceptible of a reply based on law; indeed it is scarcely susceptible of a reply otherwise than on the basis of law. In the view of the Court, it is indeed a question of a legal character (see Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, 1. C..J. Reports 1975, p. 18, para. 15).\n\n38. The Court would point out that lack of clarity in the drafting of a question does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Rather, such uncertainty will require clarification in interpretation, and such necessary clarifications of interpretation have frequently been given by the Court.  In the past, both the Permanent Court and the present Court have observed in some cases that the wording of a request for an advisory opinion did not accurately state the question on which the Court's opinion was being sought (Interpretation Q/â€¢ the Greco -Turkish Agreement of I December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 16 (I), pp. 14 -16), or did not correspond to the \"true legal question\" under consideration (Interpretation Q/' the Agreement of 25 March 1951 between the WII() and Egypt, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1980, pp. 87 -89, paras. 34 -36). The Court noted in one case that \"the question put to the Court is, on the face of it, at once infelicitously expressed and vague\" (Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1982, p. 348, para. 46).\n\nConsequently, the Court has often been required to broaden, interpret and even reformulate the questions put (see the three Opinions cited above; see also Jaworzina, Advisory' Opinion, 1923, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 8; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1956, p. 25; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, pp. 157 -162).  In the present instance, the Court will only have to do what it has often done in the past, namely \"identify the existing principles and rules, interpret them and apply them ..., thus offering a reply to the question posed based on law\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I. C. J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 234, para. 13).\n\n39. In the present instance, if the General Assembly requests the Court to state the \"legal consequences\" arising from the construction of the wall, the use of these terms necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in b reach of certain rules and principles of international law. Thus, the Court is first called upon to determine whether such rules and principles have been and are still being breached by the construction of the wall along the planned route.\n\n40. The Court does not consider that what is contended to be the abstract nature of the question posed to it raises an issue of jurisdiction. Even when the matter was raised as an issue of propriety rather than one of jurisdiction, in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use o/ Nuclear Weapons, the Court took the position that to contend that it should not deal with a question couched in abstract terms is \"a mere affirmation devoid of any justification\" and that \"the Court may give an advisory op inion on any legal question, abstract or otherwise\" (l. C\". J. Reports 1996 ( I), p. 236, para. 15, referring to Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I. C.I Reports 1947 -1948, p. 61 ; of Awards o/' Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C.I. Reports 1954, p. 5 1 ; and Legal Consequences for States the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40). In any event, the Court considers that the question posed to it in relation to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall is not an abstract one, and moreover that it would be for the Court to determine for whom any such consequences arise.\n\n41. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the view, which has also been advanced in the present proceedings, that it has no jurisdiction because of the \"political\" character of the question posed. As is clear from its long -standing jurisprudence on this point, the Court considers that the fact that a legal question also has political aspects, \"as, in the nature of things, is the case with so many questions which arise in international life, does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a 'legal question' and to 'deprive the Court of a competence expressly conferred on it by its Statute' (Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1973, p. 172, para. 14). Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law (cf.. Conditions of Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations (Article 4 of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, 1948, I.C.J. Report s 1947 -1948, pp. 61 -62; Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of the a State to the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, pp. 6 -7; Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155).\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 234, para. 13.) In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of the Agreement of25 March 1951 between the WHO and Egypt, the Court indeed emphasized that,  in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable with respect to the matter under debate . (l . c.]. Reports 1980, p. 87, para. 33).  Moreover, the Court has affirmed in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons that  \"the political nature of the motives which may be said to have inspired the request and the political implications that the opinion given might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to give such an opinion\" (l. c. J. Reports 19 96 (I), p. 234, para. 13).  The Court is of the view that there is no element in the present proceedings which could lead it to conclude otherwise.\n\n42. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by resolution ES -10/14 of the General Assembly."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 234-2115, para. 14). The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I.

Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.

Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P.

One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53.

C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 234-2115, para. 14). The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion.

The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P.

It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases.

The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 234-2115, para. 14). The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter.

Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict.

C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations.

C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61.

The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.

The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1.

The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases.

One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict.

Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 234-2115, para. 14). The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion.

It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution.

Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.

Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P.

It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases.

Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations.

The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 234-2115, para. 14). The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter.

C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations.

C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I.

Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 234-2115, para. 14). The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above.

It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases.

As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce.

One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53.

Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I.

Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population.

There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

It has been contended in the present proceedings, however, that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the presence of specific aspects of the General Assembly's request that would render the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction improper and inconsistent with the Court's judicial function.\n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that \"The Court may give an advisory opinion . . .\" (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 234-2115, para. 14). The Court however is mindful of the fact that its answer 'to a request for an advisory opinion \"represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refuse\"(Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71 : see also.. for example, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of u Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the \"principal judicial organ of the United Nations\" (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only \",compelling reasons\" should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above. The Court will accordingly examine in detail and in the light of its jurisprudence each of the arguments presented to it in this regard.\n\n46. The first such argument is to the effect that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction in the present case because the request concerns a contentious matter between Israel and Palestine, in respect of which Israel has not consented to the exercise of  that jurisdiction. According to this view, the subject -matter of the question posed by the General Assembly \"is an integral part of the wider Israeli -Palestinian dispute concerning questions of terrorism, security, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and other related matters\". Israel has emphasized that i t has never consented to the settlement of this wider dispute by the Court or by any other means of compulsory adjudication; on the contrary, it contends that the parties repeatedly agreed that these issues are to be settled by negotiation, with the possibility of an agreement that recourse could be had to arbitration. It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases. The situation is different in regard to advisory proceedings even where the Request for an Opinion relates to a legal question actually pending bet ween States. The Court's reply is only of an advisory character: as such, it has no binding force. It follows that no State, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, can prevent the giving of an Advisory Opinion which the United Nations considers to be desirable in order to obtain enlightenment as to the course of action it should take. The Court's Opinion is given not to the States, but to the organ which is entitled to request it ; the reply of the Court, itself an 'organ of the United Nations', represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\" (Interpretation o/' Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 195(), p. 71 ; see also Western Sahara, I. C'. J. Reports 1975, p. 24, para. 31.)\n\n48. As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C. J. Reports 1971, p. 24, para. 34).\n\n49. Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations. The responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine (see paragraphs 70 and 7 1 below). This responsibility has been described by the General Assembly as \"a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy \" (General Assembly resolution 57/107 of 3 December 2002). Within the institutional framework of the Organization, this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n50. The object of the request before the Court is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions. The opinion is requested on a question which is of particularly acute concern t o the United Nations, and one which is located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute. In the circumstances, the Court does not consider that to give an opinion would have the effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement, and the Court accordingly cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to give an opinion on that ground.\n\n51. The Court now turns to another argument raised in the present proceedings in support of the view that it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Some participants have argued that an advisory opinion from the Court on the legality of the wall and the legal consequences of its construction could impede a political, negotiated solution 10 the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. More particularly, it has been contended that such an opinion could undermine the scheme of the \"Roadmap\" (see paragraph 22 above), which requires Israel and Palestine to comply with certain obligations in various phases referred to therein. The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion.

The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion."

    \n\n44. The Court has recalled many times in the past that Article 65, paragraph 1, of its Statute, which provides that The Court may give an advisory opinion ... (emphasis added), should be interpreted to mean that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met (Legality of the Threat or Use of' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.

Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.) Given its responsibilities as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (Article 92 of the Charter), the Court should in principle not decline to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with its consistent jurisprudence, only ,compelling reasons should lead the Court to refuse its opinion (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 155; see also, for example:, Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I. C.J. Reports 1999 (I), pp. 78-79, para. 29.)  The present Court has never, in the exercise of this discretionary power, declined to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. Its decision not to give the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict requested by the World Health Organization was based on the Court's lack of jurisdiction, and not on considerations of judicial propriety (see I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 235, para. 14). Only on one occasion did the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, take the view that it should  not reply to a question put to it (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P. C..I. J., Series B, No. 5), but this was due to  \"the very particular circumstances of the case, among which were that the question directly concerned an already existing dispute, one of the States parties to which was neither a party to the Statute of the Permanent Court nor a Member of the League of Nations, objected to the proceedings, and refused to take part in any way\" (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), pp. 235-236, para. 14).\n\n45. These considerations do not release the Court from the duty to satisfy itself, each time it is seised of a request for an opinion, as to the propriety of the exercise of its judicial function, by reference to the criterion of \"compelling reasons\" as cited above.

It is accordingly contended that the Court should decline to give the present Opinion, on the basis inter alia of the precedent of the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice  on the Status of Eastern Carelia.\n\n47. The Court observes that the lack of consent to the Court's contentious jurisdiction by interested States has no bearing on the Court's jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion. In an Advisory Opinion of 195(), the Court explained that: \"The consent of States, parties to a dispute, is the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in contentious cases.

As regards the request for an advisory opinion now before it, the Court acknowledges that Israel and Palestine have expressed radically divergent views on the legal consequences of Israel's construction of the wall, on which the Court has been asked to pronounce. However, as the Court has itself noted, \"Differences of views . on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding\" (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (197()), Advisory Opinion, a C.

Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the subject-matter of the General Assembly's request can be regarded as only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine. Given the powers and responsibilities of the United Nations in questions relating to international peace and security, it is the Court's view that the construction of the wall must be deemed to be directly of concern to the United Nations.

The requested opinion, it has been alleged, could complicate the negotiations envisaged in the \"Roadmap\", and the Court should therefore exercise it s discretion and decline to reply to the question put.  This is a submission of a kind which the Court has already had to consider several times in the past. For instance, in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the 7hreal or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court stated :  \"It has ... been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations and would, therefore, be contrary to the interest of the United Nations. The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in any opinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are no evident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p. 237, para. 17; see also Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 73.)\n\n52. One participant in the present proceedings has indicated that the Court, if it were to give a response to the request, should in any event do so keeping in mind two key aspects of the peace process: the fundamental principle that permanent status issues must be resolved through negotiations; and the need during the interim period for the parties to fulfil their security responsibilities so that the peace process can succeed.\n\n53. The Court is conscious that the \"Roadmap\", which was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) (see paragraph 22 above), constitutes a negotiating framework for the resolution of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. It is not clear, however,  what influence the Court's opinion might have on those negotiations: participants in the present proceedings have expressed differing views in this regard. The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\n54. It was also put to the Court by certain participants that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could not be properly addressed in the present proceedings. The Court does not however consider this a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. The Court is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give. At the same ti me, the question that the General Assembly has chosen to ask of the Court is confined to the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, and the Court would only examine other issues to the extent that they might be necessary to its consideration of the question put to it.\n\n55. Several participants in the proceedings have raised the further argument that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because it does not have at its disposal the requisite facts and evidence to enable it to reach its conclusions. In particular, Israel has contended, referring to the Advisory Opinion on t he Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, that the Court could not give an opinion on issues which raise questions of fact that cannot be elucidated without hearing all parties to the conflict. According to Israel, if the Court decided to give the requested opinion, it would be forced to speculate about essential facts and make assumptions about arguments of law. More specifically, Israel has argued that the Court could not rule on the legal consequences of the construction of  the wall without enquiring, first, into the nature and scope of the security threat to which the wall is intended to respond and the effectiveness of that response, and, second, into the impact of the construction for the Palestinians. This task, which would already be difficult in a contentious case, would be further complicated in an advisory proceedings particularly since Israel alone possesses much of the necessary information and has stated that it chooses not to address the merits. Israel has concluded that the Court, confronted with factual issues impossible to clarify in the present proceedings, should use its discretion and decline to comply with the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n56. The Court observes that the question whether the evidence available to it is sufficient to give an advisory opinion must be decided in each particular instance. In its Opinion concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 72) and again in its Opinion on the Western Sahara, the Court made it clear that what is decisive in these circumstances is  \"whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, I. C.  J. Reports 1975, pp. 28 -29, para. 46).  Thus, for instance, in the proceedings concerning the Status of Eastern Carelia, the Permanent Court of International Justice decided to decline to give an opinion inter alia because the question put \"raised a question of fact which could not be elucidated without hearing both parties' (Interpretation of  Peace Treaties With Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, I.C.J. Reports 195(), p. 72; see Status of Eastern Carelia, P. C.I. J. , Series B, No. 5, p. 28). the other hand, in the Western Sahara Opinion, the Court observed that it had been provided with very extensive documentary evidence of the relevant facts (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 29, para. 47).\n\n57. In the present instance, the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary -General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, comprising not only detailed information on the route or  the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio -economic impact on the Palestinian population. The dossier includes several reports based on onsite visits by special rapporteurs and competent organs of the United Nations. The Secretary General has further submitted to the Court a written statement updating his report, which supplemented the information contained therein. Moreover, numerous other participants have submitted to the Court written statements which contain information relevant to a response to t he question put by the General Assembly. The Court notes in particular that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and judicial propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes; many other documents issued by the Israeli Government on those matters are in the public domain.\n\n58. The Court finds that it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. Moreover, the circumstance that others may evaluate and interpret these facts in a subjective or political manner can be no argument for a court of law to abdicate its judicial task. There is therefore in the present case no  lack of information such as to constitute a compelling reason for the Court to decline to give the requested opinion.\n\n59. In their written statements, some participants have also put forward the argument that the Court should decline to give the requested opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the wall because such opinion would lack any useful purpose. They  have argued that the advisory opinions of' the Court are to be seen as a means to enable an organ or agency in need of  legal clarification for its future action to obtain that clarification. In the present  instance, the argument continues, the General Assembly would not need an opinion of the Court because it has already declared the construction of the  wall to be illegal and has already determined the legal consequences by  demanding that Israel stop and reverse its construction, and further, because  the General Assembly has never made it clear how it intended to use the  opinion.\n\n60. As is clear from the Court's jurisprudence, advisory opinions have the purpose of furnishing to the requesting organs the elements of law necessary for them in their action. In its Opinion concerning Reservations to the  Convention on the Prevention an d Punishment of the Crime o/' Genocide, the  Court observed: \"The object of this request for an Opinion is to guide the  United Nations in respect of its own action.\" (I. C J. Reports 1951, p. 19.)  Likewise, in its Opinion on the Legal Consequences  for States of the  Continued Presence South Africa in Namibia (South  West Africa)  notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), the  Court noted: \"The request is put forward by a United Nations organ with  reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the  consequences and implications of  these decisions.\" (I. C.J. Reports 1971, p.  24, para. 32.) The Court found on another occasion that the advisory opinion  it was to give would \"furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal  character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western  Sahara\" ( Western Sahara, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 37, para. 72).\n\n61. With regard to the argument that the General Assembly has not made  it clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, the Court  would recall, as equally relevant in the present proceedings, what it stated in  its Opinion on the Legality' of  the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons :  \"Certain States have observed that the General Assembly has not  explained to the Court for what precise purposes it seeks the advisory  opinion. Nevertheless, it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide  whether or not an advisory opinion is needed b y the Assembly for the  performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to  decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own  needs.\" (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16.)\n\n62. It follows that the Court cannot decline to answer the question posed based on the ground that its opinion would lack any useful purpose. The Court cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks  such opinion, namely the General Assembly. Furthermore, and in any event, the Court considers that the General Assembly has not yet determined all the possible consequences of its own resolution. The Court's task would be to determine in a comprehensive manner the legal consequences of the construction of the wall, while the General Assembly and the Security Council  may then draw conclusions from the Court's findings.\n\n63. Lastly, the Court will turn to another argument advanced with regard to the propriety of its giving an advisory opinion in the present proceedings. Israel has contended that Palestine, given its responsibility for acts of violence against Israel and its population which the wall is aimed at addressing, cannot seek from the Court a remedy for a situation resulting from its own wrongdoing. In this context, Israel has invoked the maxim nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria, which it considers to  be as relevant in advisory proceedings as it is in contentious cases. Therefore, Israel concludes, good faith and the principle of \"clean hands\" provide a compelling reason that should lead the Court to refuse the General Assembly's request.\n\n64. The Court does not consider this argument to be pertinent. As was emphasized earlier, it was the General Assembly which requested the advisory opinion, and the opinion is to be given to the General Assembly, and not to a specific State or entity.\n\n65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes not only that it has jurisdiction to give an opinion on the question put to it by the General Assembly (see paragraph 42 above), but also that there is no compelling reason for it to use its discretionary power not to give that opinion.
    \n\nDECLARATION OF JUDGE BUERGENTHAL
    \n\n1. Since I believe that the Court should have exercised its discretion and declined to render the requested advisory opinion, 1 dissent from its decision to hear the case. My negative votes with regard to the remaining items of the dispositif should not be seen as reflecting my view that the construction of the wall by lsrael on the Occupied Palestinian Territory does not raise serious questions as a matter of international law. I believe it does, and there is much in the Opinion with which I agree. However, I am compelled to vote against the Court's findings on the merits because the Court did not have before it the requisite factual bases for its sweeping findings; it should therefore have declined to hear the case. In reaching this conclusion, I am guided by what the Court said in Western Sahara, where it emphasized that the critical question in determining whether or not to exercise its discretion in acting on an advisory opinion request is whether the Court has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character (Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, pp. 28-29, para. 46). \n\nIn my view, the absence in this case of the requisite information and evidence vitiates the Court's findings on the merits.
    \n\n2. I share the Court's conclusion that international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, and international human rights law are applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory and must there be faithfully complied with by Israel. I accept that the wall is causing deplorable suffering to many Palestinians living in that territory. In this connection, I agree that the means used to defend against terrorism must conform to all applicable rules of international law and that a State which is the victim of terrorism may not defend itself against this scourge by resorting to measures international law prohibits.
    \n\n3. It may well be, and I am prepared to assume it, that on a thorough analysis of all relevant facts, a finding could well be made that some or even all segments of the wall being constructed by Israel on the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate international law (see para. 10 below). But to reach that conclusion with regard to the wall as a whole withouthaving before it or seeking to ascertain al1 relevant facts bearing directly on issues of Israel's legitimate right of self-defence, military necessity and security needs, given the repeated deadly terrorist attacks in and upon Israel proper coming from the Occupied Palestinian Territory to which Israel has been and continues to be subjected, cannot be justified as a matter of law. The nature of these cross-Green Line attacks and their impact on Israel and its population are never really seriously examined by the Court, and the dossier provided the Court by the United Nations on which the Court to a large extent bases its findings barely touches on that subject. I am not suggesting that such an examination would relieve Israel of the charge that the wall it is building violates international law, either in whole or in part, only that without this examination the findings made are not legally well founded. In my view, the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people would have been better served had the Court taken these considerations into account, for that would have given the Opinion the credibility I believe it lacks.
    \n\n4. This is true with regard to the Court's sweeping conclusion that the wall as a whole, to the extent that it is constructed on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, violates international humanitarian law and international human rights law. It is equally true with regard to the finding that the construction of the wall severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right (para. 122). I accept that the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination and that it is entitled to be fully protected. But assuming without necessarily agreeing that this right is relevant to the case before us and that it is being violated, Israel's right to self-defence, if applicable and legitimately invoked, would nevertheless have to preclude any wrongfulness in this regard. See Article 21 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, which declares: The wrongfulness of an act of a State is precluded if the act constitutes a lawful measure of self-defence taken in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
    \n\n5. Whether Israel's right of self-defence is in play in the instant case depends, in my opinion, on an examination of the nature and scope of the deadly terrorist attacks to which Israel proper is being subjected from across the Green Line and the extent to which the construction of the wall, in whole or in part, is a necessary and proportionate response to these attacks. As a matter of law, it is not inconceivable to me that some segments of the wall being constructed on Palestinian territory meet that test and that others do not. But to reach a conclusion either way, one has to examine the facts bearing on that issue with regard to the specific segments of the wall, their defensive needs and related topographical considerations. Since these facts are not before the Court, it is compelled to adopt the to me legally dubious conclusion that the right of legitimate or inherent self-defence is not applicable in the present case. The Court puts the matter as follows:\n\nArticle 51 of the Charter ... recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State. The Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self-defence. \n\nConsequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case. (Para. 139.) 
    \n\n6. There are two principal problems with this conclusion. The first is that the United Nations Charter, in affirming the inherent right of self-defence, does not make its exercise dependent upon an armed attack by another State, leaving aside for the moment the question whether Palestine, for purposes of this case, should not be and is not in fact being assimilated by the Court to a State. Article 51 of the Charter provides that Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations .... Moreover, in the resolutions cited by the Court, the Security Council has made clear that international terrorism constitutes a threat to international peace and security while reaffirming the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence as recognized by the Charter of the United Nations as reiterated in resolution 1368 (2001) (Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)). In its resolution 1368 (2001), adopted only one day after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, the Security Council invokes the right of self-defence in calling on the international community to combat terrorism. In neither of these resolutions did the Security Council limit their application to terrorist attacks by State actors only, nor was an assumption to that effect implicit in these resolutions. In fact, the contrary appears to have been the case. (See Thomas Franck, Terrorism and the Right of Self-Defense, American Journal of International Law, Vol. 95, 2001, pp. 839-840.)\n\nSecond, Israel claims that it has a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks to which it is subjected on its territory from across the Green Line and that in doing so it is exercising its inherent right of self-defence. In assessing the legitimacy of this claim, it is irrelevant that Israel is alleged to exercise control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory - whatever the concept of control means given the attacks Israel is subjected from that territory - or that the attacks do not originate from outside the territory. For to the extent that the Green Line is accepted by the Court as delimiting the dividing line between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, to that extent the territory from which the attacks originate is not part of Israel proper. Attacks on Israel coming from across that line must therefore permit Israel to exercise its right of self-defence against such attacks, provided the measures it takes are otherwise consistent with the legitimate exercise of that right. To make that judgment, that is, to determine whether or not the construction of the wall, in whole or in part, by Israel meets that test, all relevant facts bearing on issues of necessity and proportionality must be analysed. The Court's formalistic approach to the right of self-defence enables it to avoid addressing the very issues that are at the heart of this case.
    \n\n7. In summarizing its finding that the wall violates international humanitarian law and international human rights law, the Court has the following to Say: \n\nTo sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. (Para. 137.) 
    \n\nThe Court supports this conclusion with extensive quotations of the relevant legal provisions and with evidence that relates to the suffering the wall has caused along some parts of its route. But in reaching this conclusion, the Court fails to address any facts or evidence specifically rebutting Israel's claim of military exigencies or requirements of national security.It is true that in dealing with this subject the Court asserts that it draws on the factual summaries provided by the United Nations Secretary-General as well as some other United Nations reports. It is equally true, however, that the Court barely addresses the summaries of Israel's position on this subject that are attached to the Secretary-General's report and which contradict or cast doubt on the material the Courtclaims to rely on. Instead, all we have from the Court is a description of the harm the wall is causing and a discussion of various provisions of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments followed by the conclusion that this law has been violated. Lacking is an examination of the facts that might show why the alleged defences of military exigencies, national security or public order are not applicable to the wall as a whole or to the individual segments of its route. The Court says that it is not convinced but it fails to demonstrate why it is not convinced, and that is why these conclusions are not convincing. 
    \n\n8. It is true that some international humanitarian law provisions the Court cites admit of no exceptions based on military exigencies. Thus, Article 46 of the Hague Rules provides that private property must be respected and may not be confiscated. In the Summary of the legal position of the Government of Israel, Annex I to the report of the United Nations Secretary-General (A/ES-10/248, p. 8), the Secretary-General reports Israel's position on this subject in part as follows:
    \n\nThe Government of Israel argues: there is no change in ownership of the land; compensation is available for use of land, crop yield  or damage to the land; residents can petition the Supreme Court to halt or alter construction and there is no change in resident status.
    \n\nThe Court fails to address these arguments. While these Israeli submissions are not necessarily determinative of the matter, they should have been dealt with by the Court and related to Israel's further claim that the wall is a temporary structure, which the Court takes note of as an assurance given by Israel (para. 121).
    \n\n9. Paragraph 6 of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention also does not admit for exceptions on grounds of military or security exigencies. It provides that the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. I agree that this provision applies to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that their existence violates Article 49, paragraph 6. It follows that the segments of the wall being built by Israel to protect the settlements are ipso facto in violation of international humanitarian law. Moreover, given the demonstrable great hardship to which the affected Palestinian population is being subjected in and around the enclaves created by those segments of the wall, I seriously doubt that the wall would here satisfy the proportionality requirement to qualify as a legitimate measure of self-defence.
    \n\n10. A final word is in order regarding my position that the Court should have declined, in the exercise of its discretion, to hear this case. In this connection, it could be argued that the Court lacked many relevant facts bearing on Israel's construction of the wall because Israel failed to present them, and that the Court was therefore justified in relying almost exclusively on the United Nations reports submitted to it. This proposition would be valid if, instead of dealing with an advisory opinion request, the Court had before it a contentious case where each party has the burden of proving its claims. But that is not the rule applicable to advisory opinion proceedings which have no parties. Once the Court recognized that Israel's consent to these proceedings was not necessary since the case was not brought against it and Israel was not a party to it, Israel had no legal obligation to participate in these proceedings or to adduce evidence supporting its claim regarding the legality of the wall. While I have my own views on whether it was wise for Israel not to produce the requisite information, this is not an issue for me to decide. The fact remains that it did not have that obligation. The Court may therefore not draw any adverse evidentiary conclusions from Israel's failure to supply it or assume, without itself fully enquiring into the matter, that the information and evidence before it is sufficient to support each and every one of its sweeping legal conclusions.

The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).\n\n150. The Court observes that Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an end to that act is well established in general international law, and the Court has on a number of occasions confirmed the existence of that obligation (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 149; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J.

Israel accordingly has the obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built by it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, in view of the Court's finding (see paragraph 143 above) that Israel's violations of its international obligations stem from the construction of the wall and from its associated régime, cessation of those violations entails the dismantling forthwith of those parts of that structure situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152. Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\" (Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.\n\n"

The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).\n\n150. The Court observes that Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an end to that act is well established in general international law, and the Court has on a number of occasions confirmed the existence of that obligation (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 149; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J.

Israel accordingly has the obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built by it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, in view of the Court's finding (see paragraph 143 above) that Israel's violations of its international obligations stem from the construction of the wall and from its associated régime, cessation of those violations entails the dismantling forthwith of those parts of that structure situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152. Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\" (Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153.

The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it (see paragraphs 114-137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.\n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.\n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition.\n\nIt was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portions of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.\n\nIt was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.\n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co-operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor.\n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that \"the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law norm[s] and principles by Israel, particularly... international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end [to] these violations\", and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.\n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.\n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, for the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.\n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).\n\n150. The Court observes that Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an end to that act is well established in general international law, and the Court has on a number of occasions confirmed the existence of that obligation (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 149; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 44, para. 95; Haya de la Torre, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 82).\n\n151. Israel accordingly has the obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built by it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, in view of the Court's finding (see paragraph 143 above) that Israel's violations of its international obligations stem from the construction of the wall and from its associated régime, cessation of those violations entails the dismantling forthwith of those parts of that structure situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152. Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.\n\n155. The Court would observe that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnes. As the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature \"the concern of all States\" and, \"In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection\" (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33). The obligations erga omnes violated by Israel are the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and certain of its obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\n156. As regards the first of these, the Court has already observed (paragraph 88 above) that in the East Timor case, it described as \"irreproachable\" the assertion that \"the right of peoples to self-determination, as it evolved from the Charter and from United Nations practice, has an erga omnes character\" (I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). The Court would also recall that under the terms of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), already mentioned above (see paragraph 88), \"Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, and to render assistance to the United Nations in carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter regarding the implementation of the principle...\"\n\n157. With regard to international humanitarian law, the Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons it stated that \"a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and 'elementary considerations of humanity'..., that they are \"to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law\"\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 79). In the Court's view, these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character.\n\n158. The Court would also emphasize that Article I of the Fourth Geneva Convention, a provision common to the four Geneva Conventions, provides that \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\" It follows from that provision that every State party to that Convention, whether or not it is a party to a specific conflict, is under an obligation to ensure that the requirements of the instruments in question are complied with.\n\n159. Given the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, the Court is of the view that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. It is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. In addition, all the States parties to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 are under an obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to ensure compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention.\n\n160. Finally, the Court is of the view that the United Nations, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and the associated régime, taking due account of the present Advisory Opinion.\n\n"

The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it (see paragraphs 114-137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.\n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.\n\n145.

    "texto": "Question: Israel is under an obligation to make reparation for al1 damage caused by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,including in and around East Jerusalem. \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it (see paragraphs 114-137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.\n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.\n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition.\n\nIt was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portions of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.\n\nIt was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.\n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co-operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor.\n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that \"the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law norm[s] and principles by Israel, particularly... international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end [to] these violations\", and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.\n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.\n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, for the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.\n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).\n\n150. The Court observes that Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an end to that act is well established in general international law, and the Court has on a number of occasions confirmed the existence of that obligation (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 149; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 44, para. 95; Haya de la Torre, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 82).\n\n151. Israel accordingly has the obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built by it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, in view of the Court's finding (see paragraph 143 above) that Israel's violations of its international obligations stem from the construction of the wall and from its associated régime, cessation of those violations entails the dismantling forthwith of those parts of that structure situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152. Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.\n\n155. The Court would observe that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnes. As the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature \"the concern of all States\" and, \"In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection\" (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33). The obligations erga omnes violated by Israel are the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and certain of its obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\n156. As regards the first of these, the Court has already observed (paragraph 88 above) that in the East Timor case, it described as \"irreproachable\" the assertion that \"the right of peoples to self-determination, as it evolved from the Charter and from United Nations practice, has an erga omnes character\" (I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). The Court would also recall that under the terms of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), already mentioned above (see paragraph 88), \"Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, and to render assistance to the United Nations in carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter regarding the implementation of the principle...\"\n\n157. With regard to international humanitarian law, the Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons it stated that \"a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and 'elementary considerations of humanity'..., that they are \"to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law\"\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 79). In the Court's view, these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character.\n\n158. The Court would also emphasize that Article I of the Fourth Geneva Convention, a provision common to the four Geneva Conventions, provides that \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\" It follows from that provision that every State party to that Convention, whether or not it is a party to a specific conflict, is under an obligation to ensure that the requirements of the instruments in question are complied with.\n\n159. Given the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, the Court is of the view that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. It is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. In addition, all the States parties to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 are under an obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to ensure compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention.\n\n160. Finally, the Court is of the view that the United Nations, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and the associated régime, taking due account of the present Advisory Opinion.\n\n"

It is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. In addition, all the States parties to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 are under an obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to ensure compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention.\n\n160. Finally, the Court is of the view that the United Nations, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and the associated régime, taking due account of the present Advisory Opinion.\n\n"

    "texto": "Question: Israel is under an obligation to make reparation for al1 damage caused by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,including in and around East Jerusalem. \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it (see paragraphs 114-137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.\n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.\n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition.\n\nIt was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portions of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.\n\nIt was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.\n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co-operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor.\n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that \"the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law norm[s] and principles by Israel, particularly... international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end [to] these violations\", and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.\n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.\n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, for the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.\n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).\n\n150. The Court observes that Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an end to that act is well established in general international law, and the Court has on a number of occasions confirmed the existence of that obligation (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 149; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 44, para. 95; Haya de la Torre, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 82).\n\n151. Israel accordingly has the obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built by it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, in view of the Court's finding (see paragraph 143 above) that Israel's violations of its international obligations stem from the construction of the wall and from its associated régime, cessation of those violations entails the dismantling forthwith of those parts of that structure situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152. Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.\n\n155. The Court would observe that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnes. As the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature \"the concern of all States\" and, \"In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection\" (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33). The obligations erga omnes violated by Israel are the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and certain of its obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\n156. As regards the first of these, the Court has already observed (paragraph 88 above) that in the East Timor case, it described as \"irreproachable\" the assertion that \"the right of peoples to self-determination, as it evolved from the Charter and from United Nations practice, has an erga omnes character\" (I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). The Court would also recall that under the terms of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), already mentioned above (see paragraph 88), \"Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, and to render assistance to the United Nations in carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter regarding the implementation of the principle...\"\n\n157. With regard to international humanitarian law, the Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons it stated that \"a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and 'elementary considerations of humanity'..., that they are \"to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law\"\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 79). In the Court's view, these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character.\n\n158. The Court would also emphasize that Article I of the Fourth Geneva Convention, a provision common to the four Geneva Conventions, provides that \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\" It follows from that provision that every State party to that Convention, whether or not it is a party to a specific conflict, is under an obligation to ensure that the requirements of the instruments in question are complied with.\n\n159. Given the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, the Court is of the view that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. It is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end.

With regard to international humanitarian law, the Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons it stated that \"a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and 'elementary considerations of humanity'..., that they are \"to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law\"\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 79). In the Court's view, these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character.\n\n158. The Court would also emphasize that Article I of the Fourth Geneva Convention, a provision common to the four Geneva Conventions, provides that \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\" It follows from that provision that every State party to that Convention, whether or not it is a party to a specific conflict, is under an obligation to ensure that the requirements of the instruments in question are complied with.\n\n159. Given the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, the Court is of the view that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. It is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. In addition, all the States parties to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 are under an obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to ensure compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention.\n\n160. Finally, the Court is of the view that the United Nations, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and the associated régime, taking due account of the present Advisory Opinion.\n\n"

    "texto": "Question: Israel is under an obligation to make reparation for al1 damage caused by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,including in and around East Jerusalem. \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it (see paragraphs 114-137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.\n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.\n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition.\n\nIt was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portions of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.\n\nIt was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.\n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co-operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor.\n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that \"the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law norm[s] and principles by Israel, particularly... international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end [to] these violations\", and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.\n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.\n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, for the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.\n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).\n\n150. The Court observes that Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an end to that act is well established in general international law, and the Court has on a number of occasions confirmed the existence of that obligation (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 149; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 44, para. 95; Haya de la Torre, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 82).\n\n151. Israel accordingly has the obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built by it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, in view of the Court's finding (see paragraph 143 above) that Israel's violations of its international obligations stem from the construction of the wall and from its associated régime, cessation of those violations entails the dismantling forthwith of those parts of that structure situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152. Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.\n\n155. The Court would observe that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnes. As the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature \"the concern of all States\" and, \"In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection\" (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33). The obligations erga omnes violated by Israel are the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and certain of its obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\n156. As regards the first of these, the Court has already observed (paragraph 88 above) that in the East Timor case, it described as \"irreproachable\" the assertion that \"the right of peoples to self-determination, as it evolved from the Charter and from United Nations practice, has an erga omnes character\" (I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). The Court would also recall that under the terms of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), already mentioned above (see paragraph 88), \"Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, and to render assistance to the United Nations in carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter regarding the implementation of the principle...\"\n\n157. With regard to international humanitarian law, the Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons it stated that \"a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and 'elementary considerations of humanity'..., that they are \"to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law\"\" (I.C.J.

As the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature \"the concern of all States\" and, \"In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection\" (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33). The obligations erga omnes violated by Israel are the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and certain of its obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\n156. As regards the first of these, the Court has already observed (paragraph 88 above) that in the East Timor case, it described as \"irreproachable\" the assertion that \"the right of peoples to self-determination, as it evolved from the Charter and from United Nations practice, has an erga omnes character\" (I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). The Court would also recall that under the terms of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), already mentioned above (see paragraph 88), \"Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, and to render assistance to the United Nations in carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter regarding the implementation of the principle...\"\n\n157. With regard to international humanitarian law, the Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons it stated that \"a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and 'elementary considerations of humanity'..., that they are \"to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law\"\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 79). In the Court's view, these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character.\n\n158. The Court would also emphasize that Article I of the Fourth Geneva Convention, a provision common to the four Geneva Conventions, provides that \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\" It follows from that provision that every State party to that Convention, whether or not it is a party to a specific conflict, is under an obligation to ensure that the requirements of the instruments in question are complied with.\n\n159. Given the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, the Court is of the view that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. It is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. In addition, all the States parties to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 are under an obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to ensure compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention.\n\n160. Finally, the Court is of the view that the United Nations, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and the associated régime, taking due account of the present Advisory Opinion.\n\n"

    "texto": "Question: Israel is under an obligation to make reparation for al1 damage caused by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,including in and around East Jerusalem. \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it (see paragraphs 114-137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.\n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.\n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition.\n\nIt was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portions of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.\n\nIt was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.\n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co-operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor.\n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that \"the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law norm[s] and principles by Israel, particularly... international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end [to] these violations\", and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.\n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.\n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, for the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.\n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).\n\n150. The Court observes that Israel also has an obligation to put an end to the violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an end to that act is well established in general international law, and the Court has on a number of occasions confirmed the existence of that obligation (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 149; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1980, p. 44, para. 95; Haya de la Torre, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 82).\n\n151. Israel accordingly has the obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built by it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, in view of the Court's finding (see paragraph 143 above) that Israel's violations of its international obligations stem from the construction of the wall and from its associated régime, cessation of those violations entails the dismantling forthwith of those parts of that structure situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152. Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.\n\n155. The Court would observe that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnes.

Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.\n\n155. The Court would observe that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnes. As the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature \"the concern of all States\" and, \"In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection\" (Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33). The obligations erga omnes violated by Israel are the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and certain of its obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\n156. As regards the first of these, the Court has already observed (paragraph 88 above) that in the East Timor case, it described as \"irreproachable\" the assertion that \"the right of peoples to self-determination, as it evolved from the Charter and from United Nations practice, has an erga omnes character\" (I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). The Court would also recall that under the terms of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), already mentioned above (see paragraph 88), \"Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, and to render assistance to the United Nations in carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter regarding the implementation of the principle...\"\n\n157. With regard to international humanitarian law, the Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons it stated that \"a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and 'elementary considerations of humanity'..., that they are \"to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law\"\" (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 79). In the Court's view, these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character.\n\n158. The Court would also emphasize that Article I of the Fourth Geneva Convention, a provision common to the four Geneva Conventions, provides that \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\" It follows from that provision that every State party to that Convention, whether or not it is a party to a specific conflict, is under an obligation to ensure that the requirements of the instruments in question are complied with.\n\n159. Given the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, the Court is of the view that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. It is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. In addition, all the States parties to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 are under an obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to ensure compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention.\n\n160. Finally, the Court is of the view that the United Nations, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and the associated régime, taking due account of the present Advisory Opinion.\n\n"

The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 114-137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law.

Moreover, given that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has, inter alia, entailed the requisition and destruction of homes, businesses and agricultural holdings, the Court finds further that Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned. The Court would recall that the essential forms of reparation in customary law were laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the following terms:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154. The Court will now consider the legal consequences of the internationally wrongful acts flowing from Israel's construction of the wall as regards other States.
    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE HIGGINS 
    \n\n36. The latter part of the dispositif deals with the legal consequences of the findings made by the Court. 
    \n\n37. I have voted in favour of subparagraph (3) (D) of the dispositif but, unlike the Court, i do not think that the specified consequence of the identified violations of international law have anything to do with the concept of ergu omnes (cf. paras. 154-159 of this Opinion). The Court's celebrated dictum in Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Second Phase (Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1970, p. 32, para. 33) is frequently invoked for more than it can bear. Regrettably, this is now done also in this Opinion, at paragraph 155. That dictum was directed to a very specific issue of jurisdictional locus standi. As the International Law Commission has correctly put it in the Commentaries to the draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (Al56110 at p. 278), there are certain rights in which, by reason of their importance all states have a legal interest in their protection. It has nothing to do with imposing substantive obligations on third parties to a case. 
    \n\n38. That an illegal situation is not to be recognized or assisted by third parties is self-evident, requiring no invocation of the uncertain concept of ergu onznes. It follows from a finding of an unlawful situation by the Security Council, in accordance with Articles 24 and 25 of the Charter entails decisions that are consequently binding on all States Members of the United Nations, which are thus under obligation to accept and carry them out (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (19701, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 53, para. 115). The obligation upon United Nations Members not to recognize South Africa's illegal presence in Namibia, and not to lend support or assistance, relied in no way whatever on erga omnes. Rather, the Court emphasized that A binding determination made by a competent organ of the United Nations to the effect that a situation is illegal cannot remain without consequence. (Ibid, para. 117.) The Court had already found in a contentious case that its determination of an illegal act entails a legal consequence, namely that of putting an end to an illegal situation (Haya de la Torre, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 82). Although in the present case it is the Court, rather than a United Nations organ acting under Articles 24 and 25, that has found the illegality; and although it is found in the context of an advisory opinion rather than in a contentious case, the Court's position as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations suggests that the legal consequence for a finding that an act or situation is illegal is the same. The obligation upon United Nations Members of non-recognition and non-assistance does not rest on the notion of erga omnes. 
    \n\n39. Finally, the invocation (para. 157) of the erga omnes nature of violations of humanitarian law seems equally irrelevant. These intransgressible principles are generally binding because they are customary international law, no more and no less. And the first Article to the Fourth Geneva Convention, under which The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances while apparently viewed by the Court as something to do with the erga ommes principle, is simply a provision in an almost universally ratified multilateral Convention. The Final Record of the diplomatic conference of Geneva of 1949 offers no useful explanation of that provision; the commentary thereto interprets the phrase ensure respect as going beyond legislative and other action within a State's own territory. It observes that in the event of a Power failing to fulfil its obligations, the other Contracting Parties (neutral, allied or enemy) may, and should, endeavour to bring it back to an attitude of respect for the Convention. The proper working of the system of protection provided by the Convention demands in fact that the Contracting Parties should not be content merely to apply its provisions themselves, but should do everything in their power to ensure that the humanitarian principles underlying the Conventions are applied universally. (The Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949: Commentary, IV Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war, Pictet, ed., p. 16.)\n\nIt will be noted that the Court has, in subparagraph (3) (D) of the dis- positif; carefully indicated that any such action should be in conformity with the Charter and international law. 
    \n\n40. In conclusion, i would add that, although there has indeed been much information provided to the Court in this case, that provided directly by Israel has only been very partial. The Court has based itself largely on the Secretary-General's report from 14 April2002 to 20 November 2003 and on the later Written Statement of the United Nations (see para. 79). It is not clear whether it has availed itself of other data in the public domain. Useful information is in fact contained in such documents as the Third Report of the current Special Rapporteur and Israel's Reply thereto (E/CN.4/2004/6/Add.1), as well as in The Impact of Israel's Separation Barrier on Affected West Bank Communities: An Update to the Humanitarian and Emergency Policy Group (HEPG), Constructionof the Barrier, Access, and Its Humanitarian Impact, March 2004. In any event, the Court's findings of law are notably general in character, saying remarkably little as concerns the application of specific provisions of the Hague Rules or the Fourth Geneva Convention along particular sections of the route of the wall. i have nonetheless voted in favour of subparagraph (3) (A) of the dispositif because there is undoubtedly a significant negative impact upon portions of the population of the West Bank that cannot be excused on the grounds of military necessity allowed by those Conventions; and nor has Israel explained to the United Nations or to this Court why its legitimate security needs can be met only by the route selected."

    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE KOOIJMANS 
    \n\n42. Paragraph 1 of Article 41 explicitly refers to a duty to co-operate. As paragraph 3 of the commentary states, What is called for in the face of serious breaches is a joint and coordinated effort by all States to counteract the effects of these breaches. And paragraph 2 refers to cooperation ... in the framework of a competent international organization, in particular the United Nations. Article 41, paragraph 1, therefore does not refer to individual obligations of third States as a result of a serious breach. What is said there is encompassed in the Court's finding in operative subparagraph (3) (E) and not in subparagraph (3) (D). 
    \n\n43. Article 41, paragraph 2, however, explicitly mentions the duty not to recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach just as operative subparagraph (3) (D) does. In its commentary the ILC refers to unlawful situations which - virtually without exception - take the form of a legal claim, usually to territory. It gives as examples an attempted acquisition of sovereignty over territory through denial of the right of self-determination, the annexation of Manchuria by Japan and of Kuwait by Iraq, South Africa's claim to Namibia, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Rhodesia and the creation of Bantustans in South Africa. In other words, all examples mentioned refer to situations arising from formal or quasi-formal promulgations intended to have an erga omnes effect. I have no problem with accepting a duty of non- recognition in such cases. 
    \n\n44. I have great difficulty, however, in understanding what the duty not to recognize an illegal fact involves. What are the individual addressees of this part of operative subparagraph (3) (D) supposed to do in order to comply with this obligation? That question is even more cogent considering that 144 States unequivocally have condemned the construction of the wall as unlawful (resolution ES-10/13), whereas those States which abstained or voted against (with the exception of Israel) did not do so because they considered the construction of the wall as legal. The duty not to recognize amounts, therefore, in my view to an obligation without real substance. 
    \n\n45. That argument does not apply to the second obligation mentioned in Article 41, paragraph 2, namely the obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by the serious breach. I therefore Sully support that part of operative subparagraph (3) (D). Moreover, i would have been in favour of adding in the reasoning or even in the operative part a sentence reminding States of the importance of rendering humanitarian assistance to the victims of the construction of the wall. (The Court included a similar sentence, be it with a different scope, in its Opinion in the Namibia case, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 56, para. 125.) 
    \n\n46. Finally, i have difficulty in accepting the Court's finding that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are under an obligation to ensure compliance by Israel with humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention (paragraph 159, operative subparagraph (3) (D), last part).In this respect the Court bases itself on common Article 1 of the Geneva Convention which reads: The High Contracting Parties under- take to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances. (Emphasis added.) 
    \n\n47. The Court does not say on what ground it concludes that this Article imposes obligations on third States not party to a conflict. The travaux préparatoires do not support that conclusion. According to Professor Kalshoven, who investigated thoroughly the genesis and further development of common Article 1, it was mainly intended to ensure respect of the conventions by the population as a whole and as such was closely linked to common Article 3 dealing with internal conflicts (F. Kalshoven, The Undertaking to Respect and Ensure Respect in All Circumstances: From Tiny Seed to Ripening Fruit, in Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law, Vol. 2, 1999, pp. 3-61). His conclusion from the travaux préparatoires is: I have not found in the records of the Diplomatic Conference even the slightest awareness on the part of government delegates that one might ever wish to read into the phrase 'to ensure respect' any undertaking by a contracting State other than an obligation to ensure respect for the Conventions by its people 'in all circum-stances'. (Ibid., p. 28.) 
    \n\n48. Now it is true that already from an early moment the International Committee of the Red Cross in its (non-authoritative) commentaries on the 1949 Convention has taken the position that common Article 1 contains an obligation for all States parties to ensure respect by other States parties. It is equally true that the Diplomatic Conference which adopted the 1977 Additional Protocols incorporated common Article 1 in the First Protocol. But at no moment did the Conference deal with its presumed implications for third States. 
    \n\n49. Hardly less helpful is the Court's reference to common Article 1 in the Nicaragua case. The Court, without interpreting its terms, observed that such an obligation does not derive only from the Conventions themselves, but from the general principles of humanitarian law to which the Conventions merely give specific expression. The Court continued that The United States [was] thus under an obligation not to encourage persons or groups engaged in the conflict in Nicaragua to act in violation of common Article 3 (Military und Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 114, para. 220). But this duty of abstention is completely different from a positive duty to ensure compliance with the law. 
    \n\n50. Although i certainly am not in favour of a restricted interpretationof common Article 1, such as may have been envisaged in 1949, i simply do not know whether the scope given by the Court to this Article in the present Opinion is correct as a statement of positive law. Since the Court does not give any argument in its reasoning, I do not feel able to support its finding. Moreover, i fail to see what kind of positive action, resulting from this obligation, may be expected from individual States, apart from diplomatic démarches. 
    \n\n51. For al1 these reasons i felt compelled to vote against operative sub-paragraph (3) (D)."

Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"(Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.)\n\n153. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall's construction.\n\n154.

All legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to its construction, and to the establishment of its associated régime, must forthwith be repealed or rendered ineffective, except in so far as such acts, by providing for compensation or other forms of reparation for the Palestinian population, may continue to be relevant for compliance by Israel with the obligations referred to in paragraph 153 below.\n\n152.

    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE KOOIJMANS 
    \n\n42. Paragraph 1 of Article 41 explicitly refers to a duty to co-operate. As paragraph 3 of the commentary states, What is called for in the face of serious breaches is a joint and coordinated effort by all States to counteract the effects of these breaches. And paragraph 2 refers to cooperation ... in the framework of a competent international organization, in particular the United Nations. Article 41, paragraph 1, therefore does not refer to individual obligations of third States as a result of a serious breach. What is said there is encompassed in the Court's finding in operative subparagraph (3) (E) and not in subparagraph (3) (D). 
    \n\n43. Article 41, paragraph 2, however, explicitly mentions the duty not to recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach just as operative subparagraph (3) (D) does. In its commentary the ILC refers to unlawful situations which - virtually without exception - take the form of a legal claim, usually to territory. It gives as examples an attempted acquisition of sovereignty over territory through denial of the right of self-determination, the annexation of Manchuria by Japan and of Kuwait by Iraq, South Africa's claim to Namibia, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Rhodesia and the creation of Bantustans in South Africa. In other words, all examples mentioned refer to situations arising from formal or quasi-formal promulgations intended to have an erga omnes effect. I have no problem with accepting a duty of non- recognition in such cases. 
    \n\n44. I have great difficulty, however, in understanding what the duty not to recognize an illegal fact involves. What are the individual addressees of this part of operative subparagraph (3) (D) supposed to do in order to comply with this obligation? That question is even more cogent considering that 144 States unequivocally have condemned the construction of the wall as unlawful (resolution ES-10/13), whereas those States which abstained or voted against (with the exception of Israel) did not do so because they considered the construction of the wall as legal. The duty not to recognize amounts, therefore, in my view to an obligation without real substance. 
    \n\n45. That argument does not apply to the second obligation mentioned in Article 41, paragraph 2, namely the obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by the serious breach. I therefore Sully support that part of operative subparagraph (3) (D). Moreover, i would have been in favour of adding in the reasoning or even in the operative part a sentence reminding States of the importance of rendering humanitarian assistance to the victims of the construction of the wall. (The Court included a similar sentence, be it with a different scope, in its Opinion in the Namibia case, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 56, para. 125.) 
    \n\n46. Finally, i have difficulty in accepting the Court's finding that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are under an obligation to ensure compliance by Israel with humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention (paragraph 159, operative subparagraph (3) (D), last part).In this respect the Court bases itself on common Article 1 of the Geneva Convention which reads: The High Contracting Parties under- take to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances. (Emphasis added.) 
    \n\n47. The Court does not say on what ground it concludes that this Article imposes obligations on third States not party to a conflict. The travaux préparatoires do not support that conclusion. According to Professor Kalshoven, who investigated thoroughly the genesis and further development of common Article 1, it was mainly intended to ensure respect of the conventions by the population as a whole and as such was closely linked to common Article 3 dealing with internal conflicts (F. Kalshoven, The Undertaking to Respect and Ensure Respect in All Circumstances: From Tiny Seed to Ripening Fruit, in Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law, Vol. 2, 1999, pp. 3-61). His conclusion from the travaux préparatoires is: I have not found in the records of the Diplomatic Conference even the slightest awareness on the part of government delegates that one might ever wish to read into the phrase 'to ensure respect' any undertaking by a contracting State other than an obligation to ensure respect for the Conventions by its people 'in all circum-stances'. (Ibid., p. 28.) 
    \n\n48. Now it is true that already from an early moment the International Committee of the Red Cross in its (non-authoritative) commentaries on the 1949 Convention has taken the position that common Article 1 contains an obligation for all States parties to ensure respect by other States parties. It is equally true that the Diplomatic Conference which adopted the 1977 Additional Protocols incorporated common Article 1 in the First Protocol. But at no moment did the Conference deal with its presumed implications for third States. 
    \n\n49. Hardly less helpful is the Court's reference to common Article 1 in the Nicaragua case. The Court, without interpreting its terms, observed that such an obligation does not derive only from the Conventions themselves, but from the general principles of humanitarian law to which the Conventions merely give specific expression. The Court continued that The United States [was] thus under an obligation not to encourage persons or groups engaged in the conflict in Nicaragua to act in violation of common Article 3 (Military und Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 114, para. 220). But this duty of abstention is completely different from a positive duty to ensure compliance with the law. 
    \n\n50. Although i certainly am not in favour of a restricted interpretationof common Article 1, such as may have been envisaged in 1949, i simply do not know whether the scope given by the Court to this Article in the present Opinion is correct as a statement of positive law. Since the Court does not give any argument in its reasoning, I do not feel able to support its finding. Moreover, i fail to see what kind of positive action, resulting from this obligation, may be expected from individual States, apart from diplomatic démarches. 
    \n\n51. For al1 these reasons i felt compelled to vote against operative sub-paragraph (3) (D)."

    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE ELARABY 
    \n\nI would like to express, at the outset, my complete and unqualified support for the findings and conclusions of the Court. I consider it necessary, however, to exercise my entitlement under Article 57 of the Statute, to append this separate opinion to elaborate on some of the historical and legal aspects contained in the Advisory Opinion. \n\nI feel obliged, with considerable reluctance, to start by referring to paragraph 8 of the Advisory Opinion. In my view, as Judge Lachs wrote  in his separate opinion in Military und Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) , Judgment, \n\nA judge -- as needs no emphasis - is bound to be impartial, objective, detached, disinterested and unbiased. (I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 158.) Throughout the consideration of this Advisory Opinion, I exerted every effort to be guided by this wise maxim which has a wider scope than the solemn declaration every judge makes in conformity with Article 20 of  the Statute of the International Court of Justice.  \n\nIn this separate opinion, I will address three interrelated points: \n\n(i) the nature and scope of the United Nations responsibility; \n\n(ii) the international legal status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory; \n\n(iii) the law of belligerent occupation. 
    \n\n1. The first point to be emphasized is the need to spell out the nature and the wide-ranging scope of the United Nations historical and legal responsibility towards Palestine. Indeed, the Court has referred to this special responsibility when it held that: \n\nThe responsibility of the United Nations in this matter also has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine ... this responsibility has been manifested by the adoption of many Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and by the creation of several subsidiary bodies specifically established to assist in the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian  people. (Advisory Opinion, para. 49.) \n\nWhat I consider relevant to emphasize is that this special responsibility was discharged for five decades without proper regard for the rule of law. The question of Palestine has dominated the work of the United Nations since its inception, yet no organ has ever requested the International Court of Justice to clarify the complex legal aspects of the matters under its purview. Decisions with far-reaching consequences were taken on the basis of political expediency, without due regard for the legal requirements. Even when decisions were adopted, the will to follow through to implementation soon evaporated. Competent United Nations organs, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, have adopted streams of resolutions that remain wholly or partially unfulfilled. The  United Nations special responsibility has its origin in General Assembly resolution 118 (II) of 29 November 1947 (hereafter, the Partition Resolution). \n\nProposals to seek advisory opinions prior to the adoption of the Partition Resolution were considered on many occasions in the competent subsidiary bodies but no request was ever adopted. This fact by itself confers considerable importance on the request for an advisory opinion embodied in General Assembly resolution ES-10/14 (A/ES-lO/L.l6), adopted on 8 December 2003, at the 23rd meeting of the resumed Tenth Emergency Special Session. The request is indeed a landmark in the United Nations consideration of the question of Palestine. The historical record of some previous attempts to seek the views of the International Court of Justice deserves to be recalled, albeit briefly. \n\nThe report of the Sub-Committee 2 in 1947 to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question recognized the necessity to clarify the legal issues. In paragraph 38, it was stated: \n\nThe Sub-Committee examined in detail the legal issues raised by the delegations of Syria and Egypt, and its considered views are recorded in this report. There is, however, no doubt that it would be advantageous and more satisfactory from al1 points of view if an advisory opinion on these difficult and complex legal and constitutional issues were obtained from the highest international judicial tribunal. (Document A/AC. 14/32 and Add. 1, 11 November 1947, para. 38.) \n\nThe difficult and complex legal and constitutional issues revolved around : \n\nWhether the General Assembly is competent to recommend either of the solutions proposed by the majority and by the minority respectively of the Special Committee, and whether it lies within the power of any Member or group of Members of the United Nations to implement any of the proposed solutions without the consent of the people of Palestine (document A/AC.14/32 and Add.1, 11 November 1947, para. 37).\n\nSeveral such proposals were considered. None was adopted. The Sub-Committee in its report, some two weeks before the vote on the Partition Resolution, recognized that : \n\nA refusal to submit this question for the opinion of the International Court of Justice would amount to a confession that the General Assembly is determined to make recommendations in a certain direction, not because those recommendations are in accord with the principles of international justice and fairness, but because the majority of the representatives desire to settle the problem in a certain manner, irrespective of what the merits of the question or the legal obligations of the parties might be. Such an attitude will not serve to enhance the prestige of the United Nations.... (Ibid., para. 40.) \n\nThe clear and well-reasoned arguments calling for clarification and elucidation of the legal issues fell on deaf ears. The rush to vote proceeded without clarifying the legal aspects. In this context, it is relevant to recall that the Partition Resolution fully endorsed referral of any dispute relating to the application or interpretation of its provisions to the International Court of Justice. The referral shall be ... at the request of either party. Needless to say, this avenue was also never followed.\n\nThus, the request by the General Assembly for an advisory opinion, as contained in resolution 10/14, represents the first time ever that the International Court of Justice has been consulted by a United Nations organ with respect to any aspect regarding Palestine. The Advisory Opinion has great historical significance as a landmark which will definitely add to its legal value.
    \n\n2.1. The international legal status of the Palestinian Territory (paras. 70-71 of the Advisory Opinion), in my view, merits more comprehensive treatment. An historical survey is relevant to the question posed by the General Assembly, for it serves as the background to understanding the legal status of the Palestinian Territory on the one hand and underlines the special and continuing responsibility of the General Assembly on the other. This may appear as academic, without relevance to the present events. The present is however determined by the accumulation of past events and no reasonable and fair concern for the future can possibly disregard a firm grasp of past events. In particular, when on more than one occasion the rule of law was consistently side-stepped. The point of departure, or one can say in legal jargon, the critical date, is the League of Nations Mandate which was entrusted to Great Britain. As stated in the Preamble of the Mandate for Palestine, the United Kingdom undertook to exercise it on behalf of the League of Nations. The Mandate must be considered in the light of the Covenant of the League of Nations. One of the primary responsibilities of the Mandatory Power was to assist the peoples of the territory to achieve full self-government and independence at the earliest possible date. Article 22, paragraph 1, of the Covenant stipulated that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation. The only limitation imposed by the Leagues Covenant upon the sovereignty and full independence of the people of Palestine was the temporary tutelage entrusted to the Mandatory Power. Palestine fell within the scope of Class A Mandates under Article 22, paragraph 4, of the Covenant, which provided that :\n\nCertain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. \n\nThe conventional wisdom and the general expectation were such that when the stage of rendering administrative advice and assistance had been concluded and the Mandate had come to an end, Palestine would be independent as of that date, since its provisional independence as a nation was already legally acknowledged by the Covenant. Moreover, the Covenant clearly differentiated between the communities which formerly belonged to the Turkish Empire, and other territories. Regarding the latter, the Mandatory Power was held responsible for the complete administration of the territory and was not confined to administrative advice and assistance. These distinct arrangements can be interpreted as further recognition by the Covenant of the special status of the former Turkish territories which included Palestine. In point of fact, the report submitted by Sub-Committee 2 to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question in 1947 shed more light on the status of Palestine. The report gave the conclusion that the people of Palestine are ripe for self-government and that it has been agreed on all hands that they should be made independent at the earliest possible date. It also follows, from what has been said above, that the General Assembly is not competent to recommend, still less to enforce, any solution other than the recognition of the independence of Palestine. (A/AC. 14/32, and Add. 1, 11 November 1947, para. 18.)\n\nThe Sub-Committee further submitted the following views: \n\nIt will be recalled that the object of the establishment of Class A Mandates, such as that for Palestine, under Article 22 of the Covenant, was to provide for a temporary tutelage under the Mandatory Power, and one of the primary responsibilities of the Mandatory was to assist the peoples of the mandated territories to achieve full self-government and independence at the earliest opportunity. It is generally agreed that that stage has now been reached in Palestine, and not only the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine but the Mandatory Power itself agree that the Mandate should be terminated and the independence of Palestine recognized. (Ibid., para. 15.)
    \n\n2.2. The Court has considered the legal nature of mandated territories in both 1950 (International Status of South West Africa, Advisory Opinion) and 1971 (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion), and laid down both the conceptual philosophy and the legal parameters for defining the legal status of former mandated territories. The dicta of the Court emphasized the special responsibility of the international community. It is to be noted that, in the setting up of the mandates system, the Court held that two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilization (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 13 1 ; emphasis added). \n\nThe two fundamental principles enunciated by the Court in 1950 apply to all former mandated territories which have not gained independence. They remain valid today for the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The territory cannot be subject to annexation by force and the future of the Palestinian people, as a sacred trust of civilization, is the direct responsibility and concern of the United Nations.
    \n\n2.3. It should be borne in mind that General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947, which partitioned the territory of mandated Palestine, called for, inter alia, the following steps to be undertaken:\n\n(i) the termination of the Mandate not later than 1 August 1948; \n\n(ii) the establishment of two independent States, one Arab and one Jewish; \n\n(iii) the period between the adoption of the Partition Resolution and the establishment of the independence of the Arab and Jewish States shall be a transitional period. \n\nOn 14 May 1948, the independence of the Jewish State was declared. The Israeli declaration was by virtue of Israels natural and historic right and based on the strength of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. The independence of the Palestinian Arab State has not yet materialized. \n\nThat there shall be a transitional period pending the establishment of the two States is a determination by the General Assembly within its sphere of competence and should be binding on all Member States as having legal force and legal consequences This conclusion finds support in the jurisprudence of the Court. The Court has held in the Namibia case that when the General Assembly declared the Mandate to be terminated, \n\nSouth Africa has no other right to administer the Territory. This is not a finding on facts, but the formulation of a legal situation. For it would not be correct to assume that. because the General Assembly is in principle vested with recommendatory powers, it is debarred from adopting, in specific cases within the framework of its competence, resolutions which make determinations or have operative design. (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971. p. 50, para. 105.) \n\nThe Court, moreover, has previously held, in the Certain Expenses case, that the decisions of the General Assembly on important questions under Article 18, have dispositive force and effect (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 163). \n\nThe legal force and effect of a General Assembly resolution adopted by the General Assembly within the framework of its competence is therefore well established in the Courts jurisprudence. On that basis, it is submitted that two conclusions appear imperative: \n\n(a) the United Nations is under an obligation to pursue the establishment of an independent Palestine, a fact which necessitates that the General Assemblys special legal responsibility not lapse until the achievement of this objective; \n\n(b) the transitional period referred to in the Partition Resolution serves as a legal nexus with the Mandate. The notion of a transitional period carrying the responsibilities emanating from the Mandate to the present is a political reality, not a legal fiction, and finds support in the dicta of the Court, in particular, that former mandated territories are the sacred trust of civilization and cannot be annexed. The stream of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on various aspects of the question of Palestine provides cogent proof that this notion of a transitional period is generally, albeit implicitly, accepted. 
    \n\n2.4. The legal status of the Occupied Palestinian Territories cannot be fully appreciated without an examination of Israels contractual undertakings to respect the territorial integrity of the territory, and to withdraw from the occupied territories. The withdrawal and the territorial integrity injunctions are based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967) which is universally considered as the basis for a just, viable and comprehensive settlement. Resolution 242 (1967) is a multidimensional resolution which addresses various aspects of the Arab-Israeli dispute. I will focus only on the territorial dimension of resolution 242 (1967): the resolution contained two basic principles which defined the scope and the status of the territories occupied in 1967 and confirmed that occupied territories have to be de-occupied: resolution 242 (1967) emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war, thus prohibiting the annexation of the territories occupied in the 1967 conquest. It called for the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from the territories occupied in the conflict. On 22 October 1973, the Security Council adopted resolution 338 (1973) which reiterated the necessity to implement resolution 242 (1967) in al1 of its parts (S/RES/338 of 22 October 1973, para. 2). Following resolution 242 (1967), several undertakings to end the Israeli military occupation, while reserving the territorial integrity of the West Bank and Gaza, were made by Israel: \n\n(a) The Camp David Accords of 17 September 1978, in which Israel agreed that the basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict with its neighbours is United Nations Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in all its parts. \n\n(b) The Oslo Accord, signed in Washington, D.C. on 13 September 1993, which was a bilateral agreement between Israel and Palestine. Article IV of the Oslo Accord provides that the two sides view the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a single territorial unit whose integrity will be preserved during the interim period. \n\n(c) The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, signed in Washington, D.C. on 28 September 1995, reiterated the commitment to respect the integrity and status of the Territory during the interim period. In addition, Article XXXI (7) provided that neither side shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations.\n\nThus Israel undertook to carry out the following obligations:\n\n(i) to withdraw in conformity with resolution 242 (1967);\n\n(ii) to respect the territorial integrity of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; and\n\n(iii) to refrain from taking any step that would change the status of theWest Bank and Gaza.\n\nThese undertakings were contractual and are legally binding on Israel.
    \n\n2.5. Yet, notwithstanding the general prohibition against annexing occupied territories, the dicta of the Court on the legal nature of formermandatory territories, and in clear contravention of binding bilateralundertakings, on 14 April 2004, the Prime Minister of Israel addressed aletter to the President of the United States. Attached to the letter is aDisengagement Plan which one has to interpret as authoritatively reflecting Israels intention to annex Palestinian territories. The DisengagementPlan provides that it is clear that in the West Bank, there are areas which will be partof the State of Israel, including cities, towns and villages, securityareas and installations, and other places of special interest to Israel.\n\nThe clear undertakings to withdraw and to respect the integrity andstatus of the West Bank and Gaza legally debar Israel from infringingupon or altering the international legal status of the Palestinian territory.The construction of the wall, with its chosen route and associated régime,has to be read in the light of the Disengagement Plan. It is safe to assumethat the construction was conceived with a view to annexing Palestinian territories, cities, towns and villages in the West Bank which will bepart of the State of Israel. The letter of the Prime Minister of Israel wasdated 14 April 2004, over two months before the delivery of the Advisory Opinion.The Court reached the correct conclusion regarding the characterization of the wall when it held that: \n\nThe construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation (Advisory Opinion, para. 121). \n\nIt is submitted that this finding should have been reflected in the dispositif with an affirmation that the Occupied Palestinian Territory cannot be annexed. It would also have been appropriate, in my view, to refer to the implications of the letter of the Prime Minister of Israel and its attachments and to underline that what it purports to declare is a breach of Israels obligations and contrary to international law. \n\nThe Court was requested by the General Assembly to urgently render an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (A/RES/ES- 10/14-A/ES-1O/L. 16). The focus of the request evolves around the law of belligerent occupation. As already stated, I do concur with the reasoning and conclusions in the Advisory Opinion. I feel constrained, however, to emphasize and elaborate on some points: \n\n(a) the prolonged occupation; \n\n(b) the scope and limitations of the principle of military necessity; \n\n(c) the grave breaches of international humanitarian law; and \n\n(d) the right to self-determination. 
    \n\n3.1. The prohibition of the use of force, as enshrined in Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter, is no doubt the most important principle that emerged in the twentieth century. It is universally recognized as a jus cogens principle, a peremptory norm from which no derogation is permitted. The Court recalls in paragraph 87, the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (resolution 2625 (XXV)), which provides an agreed interpretation of Article 2 (4). The Declaration emphasized that No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal (Advisory Opinion, para. 87). The general principle that an illegal act cannot produce legal rights - ex injuria jus non oritur - is well recognized in international law. \n\nThe Israeli occupation has lasted for almost four decades. Occupation, regardless of its duration, gives rise to a myriad of human, legal and political problems. In dealing with prolonged belligerent occupation, international law seeks to perform a holding operation pending the termination of the conflict. No one underestimates the inherent difficulties that arise during situations of prolonged occupation. A prolonged occupation strains and stretches the applicable rules, however, the law of belligerent occupation must be fully respected regardless of the duration of the occupation. \n\nProfessor Christopher Greenwood provided a correct legal analysis which I share. He wrote: \n\nNevertheless, there is no indication that international law permit an occupying power to disregard provisions of the Regulations or the Convention merely because it has been in occupation for a long period, not least because there is no body of law which might plausibly take their place and no indication that the international community is willing to trust the occupant with carte blanche.\n\nBoth Israelis and Palestinians are subjected to untold sufferings. Both Israelis and Palestinians have a right to live in peace and security. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) affirmed the right of every State in the area ... to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force (S/RES/242 (1967), para. 1 (ii)). These are solemn reciprocal rights which give rise to solemn legal obligations. The right to ensure and enjoy security applies to the Palestinians as well as to the Israelis. Security cannot be attained by one party at the expense of the other. By the same token of corresponding rights and obligations, the two sides have a reciprocal obligation to scrupulously respect and comply with the rules of international humanitarian law by respecting the rights, dignity and property of the civilians. Both sides are under a legal obligation to measure their actions by the identical yardstick of international humanitarian law which provides protection for the civilian population. \n\nThe Court has very clearly held, in the Legality of the Threat or Use ofNuclear Weapon case, that\n\nThe cardinal principles contained in the texts constituting the fabric of humanitarian law are the following. The first is aimed at the protection of the civilian population and civilian objects and establishes the distinction between combatants and non-combatants; States must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military targets. According to the second principle, it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants: it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering. In application of that second principle, States do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use. (Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 78.) \n\nThe fact that occupation is met by armed resistance cannot be used as a pretext to disregard fundamental human rights in the occupied territory. Throughout the annals of history, occupation has always been met with armed resistance. Violence breeds violence. This vicious circle weighs heavily on every action and every reaction by the occupier and the occu- pied alike. \n\nThe dilemma was pertinently captured by Professors Richard Falk and Burns Weston when they wrote the occupier is confronted by threats to its security that arise ... primarily, and especially in the most recent period, from a pronounced and sustained failure to restrict the character and terminate its occupation so as to restore the sovereign rights of the inhabitants. Israeli occupation, by its substantial violation of Palestinian rights, has itself operated as an inflaming agent that threatens the security of its administration of the territory, inducing reliance on more and more brutal practices to restore stability which in turn provokes the Palestinians even more. In effect, the illegality of the Israeli occupation regime itself set off an escalatory spiral of resistance and repression, and under these conditions al1 considerations of morality and reason establish a right of resistance inherent in the population. This right of resistance is an implicit legal corollary of the fundamental legal rights associated with the primacy of sovereign identity and assuring the humane protection of the inhabitants.\n\nI wholeheartedly subscribe to the view expressed by Professors Falk and Weston, that the breaches by both sides of the fundamental rules of humanitarian law reside in the illegality of the Israeli occupation regime itself. Occupation, as an illegal and temporary situation, is at the heart of the whole problem. The only viable prescription to end the grave violations of international humanitarian law is to end occupation.\n\nThe Security Council has more than once called for ending the occupation. On 30 June 1980, the Security Council reaffirmed the overriding necessity for ending the prolonged occupation of Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem (S/RES/476 (1980)). Not- withstanding this clarion call, the Palestinians are still languishing under a heavy-handed, prolonged occupation. 
    \n\n3.2. The Court, in paragraph 135, rejected the contention that the principle of military necessity can be invoked to justify the construction of the wall. The Court held that: \n\nHowever, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. (Advisory Opinion, para. 135.) \n\nIfully share this finding. Military necessities and military exigencies could arguably be advanced as justification for building the wall had Israel proven that it could perceive no other alternative for safeguarding its security. This, as the Court notes, Israel failed to demonstrate. A distinction must be drawn between building the wall as a security measure, as Israel contends, and accepting that the principle of military necessity could be invoked to justify the unwarranted destruction and demolition that accompanied the construction process. Military necessity, if applicable, extends to the former and not the latter. The magnitude of the damage and injury inflicted upon the civilian inhabitants in the course of building the wall and its associated régime is clearly prohibited under international humanitarian law. The destruction of homes, the demolition of the infrastructure, and the despoilment of land, orchards and olive groves that has accompanied the construction of the wall cannot be justified under any pretext whatsoever. Over 100,000 civilian non- combatants have been rendered homeless and hapless. \n\nIt is a fact that the law of belligerent occupation contains clauses which confer on the occupying Power a limited leeway for military necessities and security. As in every exception to a general rule, it has to be interpreted in a strict manner with a view to preserving the basic humanitarian considerations. The Secretary-General reported to the General Assembly on 24 November 2003 that he recognizes Israels right and duty to protect its people against terrorist attacks. However, that duty should not be carried out in a way that is in contradiction to international law ... (A/ES-10/248, para. 30.) \n\nThe jurisprudence of the Court has been consistent. In the 1949 Corfu Channel case, the Court referred to the core and fabric of the rules of humanitarian law as elementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war (Corfu Channel, Merits, Judgement, 1949, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 22). In the case concerning Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court held that\n\nthese fundamental rules are to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law (I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 257, para. 79). \n\nIn the final analysis, I have reached the same conclusion as Professor Michael Schmitt, that Military necessity operates within this paradigm to prohibit acts that are not militarily necessary; it is a principle of limitation, not authorization. In its legal sense, military necessity justifies nothing. \n\nThe Court reached the same conclusion. The Court held that \n\nIn the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction. (Advisory Opinion, para. 140.) 
    \n\n3.3. It is relevant to recall, moreover, that the reading of the reports by the two Special Rapporteurs, John Dugard and Jean Ziegler, leaves no doubt that as an occupying Power, Israel has committed grave breaches. The pattern and the magnitude of the violations committed against the non-combatant civilian population in the ancillary measures associated with constructing the wall, are, in my view, extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly (Fourth Geneva Convention, Art. 147). In the area of extending protection to civilians, the rules of international humanitarian law have progressively developed since the conclusion of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols. It is submitted that the Court should have contributed to the development of the rules of jus in bello by characterizing the destruction committed in the course of building the wall as grave breaches. 
    \n\n3.4. The Court underlined the paramount importance of the right to self-determination in our contemporary world and held in paragraph 88 : The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal V. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29). Moreover, the Court notes that the route chosen for the wall and the measures taken severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination, and is therefore a breach of Israels obligation to respect that right (Advisory Opinion, para. 122). This legally authoritative dictum, which has my full support, was confined to the reasoning.\n\nThe legal consequences that flow for all States from measures which severely impede the exercise by the Palestinians of an erga omnes right, should, in my view, have been included in the dispositif.\n\nI now approach my final comment. It is a reflection on the future. The Court, in paragraph 162, observes that in its view this tragic situation can be brought to an end only through imple- mentation in good faith of al1 relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) (Advisory Opinion, para. 162). \n\nThis finding by the Court reflects a lofty objective that has eluded the international community for a very long time. Since 22 November 1967, all efforts have been aimed at ensuring the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) which was adopted unanimously. In the course of its 37-year lifespan, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has been both praised and vilified. Yet detractors and supporters alike agree that the balance in its provisions represent the only acceptable basis for establishing a viable and just peace. The Security Council, in the after- math of the 1973 armed conflict, adopted resolution 338 (1973), which called upon the parties concerned to start immediately after the ceasefire the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in al1 of its parts (emphasis added). The obligations emanating from these resolutions are obligations of result of paramount importance. They are synallagmatic obligations in which the obligation of each party constitutes the raison dêtre of the obligation of the other. It is legally wrong and politically unsound to transform this obligation of result into a mere obligation of means, confining it to a negotiating process. Any attempt to tamper with such solemn obligation would not contribute to an outcome based on a solid foundation of law and justice. \n\nThe establishment of a just and lasting peace, as called for in Security Council resolution 242 (1967), necessitates the full implementation of the corresponding obligations by the two parties. The Advisory Opinion should herald a new era as the first concrete manifestation of a meaningful administration of justice related to Palestine. It is hoped that it will provide the impetus to steer and direct the long-dormant quest for a just peace."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).
    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE KOROMA 
    \n\n1. While concurring with the Court's findings that the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime are contrary to international law, I nevertheless con- sider it necessary to stress the following points.
    \n\n2. First and foremost. the construction of the wall has involved the annexation of parts of the occupied territory by Israel, the occupying Power, contrary to the fundamental international law principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force. The Court has confirmed the Palestinian territories as occupied territory and Israel is therefore not entitled to embark there on activities of a sovereign nature which will change their status as occupied territory. The essence of occupation is that it is only of a temporary nature and should serve the interests of the population and the military needs of the occupying Power. Accordingly, anything which changes its character, such as the construction of the wall, will be illegal. 
    \n\n3. Understandable though it is that there may be a diversity of legal views and perspectives on the question submitted to the Court, namely, the rights and obligations of an occupying Power in an occupied territory and the remedies available under international law for breaches of those obligations - a question which, in my view, is eminently legal and falls within the advisory jurisdiction of the Court - the objection is not sustainable that the Court lacks competence to rule on such a question, as determined under the United Nations Charter (Art. 96 - functional CO-operation on legal questions between the Court and the General Assembly), the Statute of the Court (Art. 65 discretionary power; and Art. 68 - assimilation with contentious procedures), the Rules of Court (Art. 102, para. 2 - assimilation with contentious proceedings), and the settled jurisprudence of the Court. Also not sustainable is the objection based on judicial propriety, which the Court duly considered in terms of its competence and of fairness in the administration of justice. In this regard, the question put to the Court is not about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as such, nor its resolution, but rather the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the occupied territory. In other words, is it permissible under existing law for an occupying Power, unilaterally, tobring about changes in the character of an occupied territory? An eminently legal question, which, in my view, is susceptible of a legal response and which does not by necessity have to assume the nature of an adjudication of a bilateral dispute; it is a request for elucidation of the applicable law. It is to that question that the Court has responded. It was therefore appropriate for the Court to exercise its advisory jurisdiction in this matter. The jurisdictional basis of the Court's Advisory Opinion is thus firmly anchored in its jurisprudence.
    \n\n4. The function of the Court in such proceedings is to ascertain and apply the law to the issue at hand. To reach its findings, the Court has applied the relevant rules of the international law of occupation as it pertainsto the Palestinian territories. Applying these rules, the Court has found that the territories were occupied territory and thus not open to annexation; that any such annexation would be tantamount to a violation of international law and contrary to international peace. Under the  régime of occupation, the division or partition of an occupied territory by the occupying Power is illegal. Moreover, in terms of contemporary inter- national law, every State is under an obligation to refrain from any action aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of any other State or country. 
    \n\n5. The Court has also held that the right of self-determination as an established and recognized right under international law applies to the territory and to the Palestinian people. Accordingly, the exercise of such right entitles the Palestinian people to a State of their own as originally envisaged in resolution 181 (II) and subsequently confirmed. The Court has found that the construction of the wall in the Palestinian territory will prevent the realization of such a right and is therefore a violation of it. 
    \n\n6. With respect to humanitarian and human rights law, the Court has rightly adjudged that both these régimes are applicable to the occupied territories; that Israel as the occupying Power is under an obligation to respect the rights of the Palestinian population of the occupied territories. Accordingly, the Court has held that the construction of the wall in the occupied territories violates the régime of humanitarian and human rights law. To put an end to such violations, the Court has rightly called for the immediate cessation of the construction of the wall and the payment of reparation for damages caused by the construction. 
    \n\n7. Equally important is the finding that the international community as a whole bears an obligation towards the Palestinian people as a former mandated territory, on whose behalf the international community holds a sacred trust, not to recognize any unilateral change in the status of the territory brought about by the construction of the wall.
    \n\n8. The Court's findings are based on the authoritative rules of international law and are of an erga omnes character. The Court's response provides an authoritative answer to the question submitted to it. Given the fact that al1 States are bound by those rules and have an interest in their observance, al1 States are subject to these findings.
    \n\n9. Just as important is the cal1 upon the parties to the conflict to respect humanitarian law in the ongoing hostilities. While it is understandable that a prolonged occupation would engender resistance, it is nonetheless incumbent on al1 parties to the conflict to respect internationalhumanitarian law at al1 times. 
    \n\n10. In making these findings, the Court has performed its role as the supreme arbiter of international legality and safeguard against illegal acts. It is now up to the General Assembly in discharging its responsibilitiesunder the Charter to treat this Advisory Opinion with the respect and seriousness it deserves, not with a view to making recriminations but to utilizing these findings in such a way as to bring about a just and peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a conflict which has not only lasted for far too long but has caused enormous suffering to those directly involved and poisoned international relations in general."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).
    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE HIGGINS 
    \n\n1. I agree with the Opinion of the Court as regards its jurisdiction in the present case and believe that paragraphs 14-42 correctly answer the various contrary arguments that have been raised on this point. 
    \n\n2. The question of discretion and propriety is very much harder. Although ultimately I have voted in favour of the decision to give the Opinion, I do think matters are not as straightforward as the Court suggests. It is apparent (not least from the wording of the request to the Court) that an attempt has been made by those seeking the Opinion to assimilate the Opinion on the wall to that obtained from the Court regarding Namibia (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 12). I believe this to be incorrect for several reasons. First and foremost, there was already, at the time of the request for an opinion in 1971 on the legal consequences of certain acts, a series of Court Opinions on South West Africa which made clear what were South Africa's legal obligations (International Status of South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 128; Voting Procedure on Questions relating to Reports and Petitions concerning the Territory of South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1955, p. 67; Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I.C. J. Reports 1956, p. 23). Further, all the legal obligations as mandatory Power lay with South West Africa. There were no legal obligations, still less unfulfilled obligations, which in 1971 lay also upon South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), as the representative of the Namibian people.
    \n\n3. In the present case, it is the General Assembly, and not the Court, which has made any prior pronouncements in respect of legality. Further, in contrast to how matters stood as regards Namibia in 1971, the larger intractable problem (of which the wall may be seen as an element) cannot be regarded as one in which one party alone has been already classified by a court as the legal wrongdoer; where it is for it alone to act to restore a situation of legality; and where from the perspective of legal obligation there is nothing remaining for the other party to do. That is evident from the long history of the matter, and is attested to by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 1515 (2003) alike. 
    \n\n4. In support of the misconceived analogy - which serves both to assist so far as legal issues of discretion are concerned, as well as wider purposes - counsel have informed the Court that The problem ... is a problem between one State - Israel - and the United Nations. (See for example, CR2004/3, p. 62, para. 31.) Of course, assimilation to the Namibia case, and a denial of any dispute save as between Israel and the United Nations, would also avoid the necessity to meet the criteria enunciated by the Court when considering whether it should give an opinion where a dispute exists between two States. But, as will be elaborated below, this cannot be avoided 
    \n\n5. Moreover, in the Namibia Opinion the Assembly sought legal advice on the consequences of its own necessary decisions on the matter in hand. The General Assembly was the organ in which now the power to terminate a League of Nations mandate was located. The Mandate was duly terminated. But Assembly resolutions are in most cases only recommendations. The Security Council, which in certain circumstances can pass binding resolutions under Chapter VII of the Charter, was not the organ with responsibility over mandates. This conundrum was at the heart of the opinion sought of the Court. Here, too, there is no real analogy with the present case. 
    \n\n6. We are thus in different legal terrain - in the familiar terrain where there is a dispute between parties, which fact does not of itself mean that the Court should not exercise its competence, provided certain conditions are met. 
    \n\n7. Since 1948 Israel has been in dispute, first with its Arab neighbours (and other Arab States) and, in more recent years, with the Palestinian Authority. Both Israel's written observations on this aspect (7.4-7.7) and the report of the Secretary-General, with its reference to the Summary Legal Position of each side, attest to this reality. The Court has regarded the special status of Palestine, though not yet an independent State, as allowing it to be invited to participate in these proceedings. There is thus a dispute between two international actors, and the advisory opinion request bears upon one element of it. 
    \n\n8. That of itself does not suggest that the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction on grounds of propriety. It is but a starting point for the Court's examination of the issue of discretion. A series of advisory opinion cases have explained how the Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923 (P. C. I. J., Series B, No. 5) principle should properly be read. Through the Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion (I. C. J. Reports 1962, p. 151); the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence ofSouth Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion (I. C. J. Reports 19 71, p. 12); and, most clearly, the Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion (I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 12), the ratio decidendi of Status of Eastern Carelia has been explained. Of these the Western Sahara case provides by far the most pertinent guidance, as it involved a dispute between international actors, in which the Court had not itself already given several advisory opinions (cf. the Namibia Opinion, which was given against the back- ground of three earlier ones on issues of legality).
    \n\n9. The Court did not in the Western Sahara case suggest that the con- sent principle to the settlement of disputes in advisory opinions had now lost all relevance for all who are United Nations Members. It was saying no more than the particular factors underlying the ratio decidendi of Status of Eastern Carelia were not present. But other factors had to be considered to see if propriety is met in giving an advisory opinion when the legal interests of a United Nations Member are the subject of that advice. 
    \n\n10. Indeed, in the Western Sahara case the Court, after citing the oft- quoted dictum from Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungaryand Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion, that an opinion given to a United Nations organ 'represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused' (I. C. J. Reports 1950, p. 71), went on to affirm that nonetheless: lack of consent might constitute a ground for declining to give the opinion requested if, in the circumstances of a given case, considerations of judicial propriety should oblige the Court to refuse an opinion. In short, the consent of an interested State continues to be relevant, not for the Court's competence, but for the appreciation of the propriety of giving an opinion. In certain circumstances. therefore. the lack of consent of an interested State may render the' giving of an advisory opinion incompatible with the Court's judicial character. (Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 25, paras. 32-33.) 
    \n\n11. What then are the conditions that in the Western Sahara case were found to make it appropriate for the Court to give an opinion even where a dispute involving a United Nations Member existed? One such was that a United Nations Member: could not validly object, to the General Assembly's exercise of its powers to deal with the decolonization of a non-self-governing territory and to seek an opinion on questions relevant to the exercise of those powers (ibid., p. 24, para. 30).Although the Assembly is not exercising either the powers of a mandate supervisory body (as in Namibia) or a body decolonizing a non-self- governing territory (as in Western Sahara), the Court correctly recounts at paragraphs 48-50 the long-standing special institutional interest of the United Nations in the dispute, of which the building of the wall now represents an element. 
    \n\n12. There remains, however, a further condition to be fulfilled, which the Court enunciated in the Western Sahara case. It states that it was satisfied that: The object of the General Assembly has not been to bring before the Court, by way of a request for advisory opinion, a dispute or legal controversy, in order that it may later, on the basis of the Court's opinion, exercise its powers and functions for the peaceful settlement of that dispute or controversy. The object of the request is an entirely different one: to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions concerning the decolonization of the territory. (Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1975, pp. 26-27, para. 39.) In the present case it is the reverse circumstance that obtains. The request is not in order to secure advice on the Assembly's decolonization duties, but later, on the basis of our Opinion, to exercise powers over the dispute or controversy. Many participants in the oral phase of this case frankly emphasized this objective. 
    \n\n13. The Court has not dealt with this point at all in that part of its Opinion on propriety. Indeed, it is strikingly silent on the matter, avoiding mention of the lines cited above and any response as to their application to the present case. To that extent, this Opinion by its very silence essentially revises, rather than applies, the existing case law. 
    \n\n14. There is a further aspect that has been of concern to me so far as the issue of propriety is concerned. The law, history and politics of the Israel-Palestine dispute is immensely complex. It is inherently awkward for a court of law to be asked to pronounce upon one element within a multifaceted dispute, the other elements being excluded from its view. Context is usually important in legal determinations. So far as the request of the Assembly envisages an opinion on humanitarian law, however, the obligations thereby imposed are (save for their own qualifying provisions) absolute. That is the bedrock of humanitarian law, and those engaged in conflict have always known that it is the price of Our hopes for the future that they must, whatever the provocation, fight with one hand behind their back and act in accordance with international law. While that factor diminishes relevance of context so far as the obligations of humanitarian law are concerned, it remains true, nonetheless, that  context is important for other aspects of international law that the Court chooses to address. Yet the formulation of the question precludes con- sideration of that context. 
    \n\n15. Addressing the reality that the question of the construction of the wall was only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Court States that it is indeed aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole, and it would take this circumstance carefully into account in any opinion it might give (para. 54). 
    \n\n16. In fact, it never does so. There is nothing in the remainder of the Opinion that can be said to cover this point. Further, I find the history as recounted by the Court in paragraphs 71-76 neither balanced nor satisfactory. 
    \n\n17. What should a court do when asked to deliver an opinion on one element in a larger problem? Clearly, it should not purport to answer these larger legal issues. The Court, wisely and correctly, avoids what we may term permanent status issues, as well as pronouncing on the rights and wrongs in myriad past controversies in the Israel-Palestine problem. What a court faced with this quandary must do is to provide a balanced opinion, made so by recalling the obligations incumbent upon all concerned. 
    \n\n18. I regret that i do not think this has been achieved in the present Opinion. It is true that in paragraph 162 the Court recalls that illegal actions and unilateral decisions have been taken on all sides and that it emphasizes that both Israel and Palestine are under an obligation scrupulously to observe the rules of international humanitarian law. But in my view much, much more was required to avoid the huge imbalance that necessarily flows from being invited to look at only part of a greater whole, and then to take that circumstance carefully into account. The call upon both parties to act in accordance with international humanitarian law should have been placed within the dispositif. The failure to do so stands in marked contrast with the path that the Court chose to follow in operative clause F of the dispositif of the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion (I. C. J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 266). Further, the Court should have spelled out what is required of both par- ties in this greater whole. This is not difficult - from Security Council resolution 242 (1967) through to Security Council resolution 1515 (2003), the key underlying requirements have remained the same - that Israel is entitled to exist, to be recognized, and to security, and that the Palestinian people are entitled to their territory, to exercise self-determination, and to have their own State. Security Council resolution 1515 (2003) envisages that these long-standing obligations are to be secured, both generally and as to their detail, by negotiation. The perceptible tragedy is that neither side will act to achieve these ends prior to the other so doing. The Court, having decided that it was appropriate to exercise its jurisdiction, should have used the latitude available to it in an advisory opinion case, and reminded both parties not only of their substantive obligations under international law, but also of the procedural obligation to move forward simultaneously. Further, i believe that, in order to achieve a balanced opinion, this latter element should also have appeared in the dispositif' itself. 
    \n\n19. I think the Court should also have taken the opportunity to say, in the clearest terms, what regrettably today apparently needs constant reaffirmation even among international lawyers, namely, that the protection of civilians remains an intransgressible obligation of humanitarian law, not only for the occupier but equally for those seeking to liberate themselves from occupation. 
    \n\n20. My vote in favour of subparagraph (2) of the dispositif has thus been made with considerable hesitation. i have voted affirmatively in the end because i agree with almost all of what the Court has written in para- graphs 44-64. My regrets are rather about what it has chosen not to write. 
    \n\n21. The way subparagraph (3) (A) of the dispositif is formulated does not separate out the various grounds that the Court relied on in reaching its conclusions. i have voted in favour of this subparagraph because i agree that the wall, being built in occupied territory, and its associated régime, entail certain violations of humanitarian law. But i do not agree with several of the other stepping stones used by the Court in reaching this generalized finding, nor with its handling of the source materials. 
    \n\n22. The question put by the General Assembly asks the Court to respond by considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions (General Assembly resolution ES-10114). It might have been anticipated that once the Court finds the Fourth Geneva Convention applicable humanitarian law would be at the heart of this Opinion. 
    \n\n23. The General Assembly has in resolution ES-10113 determined that the wall contravenes humanitarian law, without specifying which pro- visions and why. Palestine has informed the Court that it regards Articles 33, 53, 55 and 64 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 52 of the Hague Regulations as violated. Other participants invoked Articles 23 (g), 46, 50 and 52 of the Hague Regulations, and Articles 27, 47, 50, 55, 56 and 59 of the Fourth Convention. For the Special Rapporteur, the wall constitutes a violation of Articles 23 (g) and 46 of the Hague Regulations and Articles 47, 49, 50, 53 and 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It might have been expected that an advisory opinion would have contained a detailed analysis, by reference to the texts, thevoluminous academic literature and the facts at the Court's disposal, as to which of these propositions is correct. Such an approach would have followed the tradition of using advisory opinions as an opportunity to elaborate and develop international law. 
    \n\n24. It would also, as a matter of balance, have shown not only which provisions Israel has violated, but also which it has not. But the Court, once it has decided which of these provisions are in fact applicable, there- after refers only to those which Israel has violated. Further, the structure of the Opinion, in which humanitarian law and human rights law are not dealt with separately, makes it in my view extremely difficult to see what exactly has been decided by the Court. Notwithstanding the very general language of subparagraph (3) (A) of the dispositif, it should not escape attention that the Court has in the event found violations only of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (para. 120), and of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations and Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (para. 132). i agree with these findings. 
    \n\n25. After its somewhat light treatment of international humanitarian law, the Court turns to human rights law. i agree with the Court's finding about the continued relevance of human rights law in the occupied territories. I also concur in the findings made at paragraph 134 as regards Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
    \n\n26. At the same time, it has to be noted that there are established treaty bodies whose function it is to examine in detail the conduct of States parties to each of the Covenants. Indeed, the Court's response as regards the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights notes both the pertinent jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee and also the concluding observations of the Committee on Israel's duties in the occupied territories. 
    \n\n27. So far as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is concerned, the situation is even stranger, given the pro- grammatic requirements for the fulfilment of this category of rights. The Court has been able to do no more than observe, in a single phrase, that the wall and its associated régime impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ... (para. 134). For both Covenants, one may wonder about the appropriateness of asking for advisory opinions from the Court on compliance by States parties with such obligations, which are monitored, in much greater detail, by a treaty body established for that purpose. It could hardly be an answer that the General Assembly is not setting any more general precedent, because while many, many States are not in compliance with their obligations under the two Covenants, the Court is being asked to look only at the conduct of Israel in this regard.
    \n\n28. The Court has also relied, for the general determination in sub- paragraph (3) (A) of the dispositif; on a finding that Israel is in violation of the law on self-determination. It follows observations on the legally problematic route of the wall and associated demographic risks with the statement: That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right. (Para. 122.) This appears to me to be a non sequitur. 
    \n\n29. There is a substantial body of doctrine and practice on self-determination beyond colonialism. The United Nations Declaration on Friendly Relations, 1970 (General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV)) speaks also of self-determination being applicable in circumstances where peoples are subject to alien subjugation, domination, and exploitation. The General Assembly has passed many resolutions referring to the latter circumstance, having Afghanistan and the Occupied Arab Territories in mind (for example, General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX) of 1974 (Palestine); General Assembly resolution 2144 (XXV) of 1987 (Afghanistan)). The Committee on Human Rights has consistently supported this post-colonial view of self-determination. 
    \n\n30. The Court has for the very first time, without any particular legal analysis, implicitly also adopted this second perspective. i approve of the principle invoked, but am puzzled as to its application in the present case. Self-determination is the right of All peoples ... freely [to] determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development (Art. 1 (l), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and also International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). As this Opinion observes (para. 118), it is now accepted that the Palestinian people are a peoples for purposes of self-determination. But it seems to me quite detached from reality for the Court to find that it is the wall that presents a serious impediment to the exercise of this right. The real impediment is the apparent inability and / or unwillingness of both Israel and Palestine to move in parallel to secure the necessary conditions - that is, at one and the same time, for Israel to withdraw from Arab occupied territory and for Palestine to provide the conditions to allow Israel to feel secure in so doing. The simple point is underscored by the fact that if the wall had never been built, the Palestinians would still not yet have exercised their right to self-determination. It seems to me both unrealistic and unbalanced for the Court to find that the wall (rather than the larger problem, which is beyond the question put to the Court for an opinion) is a serious obstacle to self- determination. 
    \n\n31. Nor is this finding any more persuasive when looked at from a territorial perspective. As the Court states in paragraph 121, the wall does not at the present lime constitute, per. se, a de facto annexation.\n\nPeoples necessarily exercise their right to self-determination within their own territory. Whatever may be the detail of any finally negotiated boundary, there can be no doubt, as is said in paragraph 78 of the Opinion, that Israel is in occupation of Palestinian territory. That territory is no more, or less, under occupation because a wall has been built that runs through it. And to bring to an end that circumstance, it is necessary that both sides, simultaneously, accept their responsibilities under international law. 
    \n\n32. After the Court deals with the applicable law, and then applies it, it looks at possible qualifications, exceptions and defences to potential violations. 
    \n\n33. I do not agree with all that the Court has to say on the question of the law of self-defence. In paragraph 139 the Court quotes Article 51 of the Charter and then continues Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. There is, with respect, nothing in the text of Article 51 that thus stipulates that self-defence is avail- able only when an armed attack is made by a State. That qualification is rather a result of the Court so determining in Military and Paramilitary Activities in und against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Merits, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1986, p. 14). It there held that military action by irregulars could constitute an armed attack if these were sent by or on behalf of the State and if the activity because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack ... had it been carried out by regular armed forces (ibid., p. 103, para. 195). While accepting, as i must, that this is to be regarded as a statement of the law as it now stands, i maintain all the reservations as to this proposition that I have expressed elsewhere (R. Higgins, Problems and Process: International Law and How We Use It, pp. 250-251). 
    \n\n34. i also find unpersuasive the Court's contention that, as the uses of force emanate from occupied territory, it is not an armed attack by one State against another. i fail to understand the Court's view that an occupying Power loses the right to defend its own civilian citizens at home if the attacks emanate from the occupied territory - a territory which it has found not to have been annexed and is certainly other than Israel. Further, Palestine cannot be sufficiently an international entity to be invited to these proceedings, and to benefit from humanitarian law, but not sufficiently an international entity for the prohibition of armed attack on others to be applicable. This is formalism of an un- evenhanded sort. The question is surely where responsibility lies for the sending of groups and persons who act against Israeli civilians and the cumulative severity of such action. 
    \n\n35. In the event, however, these reservations have not caused me to vote against subparagraph (3) (A) of the dispositif, for two reasons. First, I remain unconvinced that non-forcible measures (such as the building of a wall) fall within self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter as that provision is normally understood. Second, even if it were an act of self- defence, properly so called, it would need to be justified as necessary and proportionate. While the wall does seem to have resulted in a diminution on attacks on Israeli civilians, the necessity and proportionality for the particular route selected, with its attendant hardships for Palestinians uninvolved in these attacks, has not been explained."

The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).
    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE KOOIJMANS 
    \n\n1. I have voted in favour of all paragraphs of the operative part of the Advisory Opinion with one exception, viz. subparagraph (3) (D) dealing with the legal consequences for States. I had a number of reasons for casting that negative vote which i will only briefly indicate at this stage, since i will come back to them when commenting on the various parts of the Opinion. My motives can be summarized as follows. \n\nFirst, the request as formulated by the General Assembly did not make it necessary for the Court to determine the obligations for States which ensue from the Court's findings. In this respect an analogy with the structure of the Opinion in the Namibia case is not appropriate. In that case the question about the legal consequences for States was at the heart of the request and logically so since it was premised on a decision of the Security Council. That resolution, and in particular its operative para- graph 5 which was addressed to all States, was considered by the Court to be essential for the purposes of the present advisory opinion (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 51, para. 108). A similar situation does not exist in the present case, where the Court's view is not asked on the legal consequences of a decision taken by a political organ of the United Nations but of an act committed by a MemberState. That does not prevent the Court from considering the issue of consequences for third States once that act has been found to be illegal  but then the Court's conclusion is wholly dependent upon its reasoning  and not upon the necessary logic of the request.\n\nIt is, however, this reasoning that in my view is not persuasive (see paras. 39-49, below) and this was my second motive for casting a negative vote. And, third, I find the Court's conclusions as laid down in sub- paragraph (3) (D) of the dispositif rather weak; apart from the Court's finding that States are under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by the construction of the wall (a finding I subscribe to) I find it difficult to envisage what States are expected to do or not to do in actual practice. In my opinion a judicial body's findings should have a direct bearing on the addressee's behaviour; neither the first nor the last part of operative subparagraph (3) (D) meets this requirement. 
    \n\n2. Although I am in general agreement with the Court's Opinion, on some issues i have reservations with regard to its reasoning. I will, in giving my comments, follow the logical order of the Opinion: \n\n(a) jurisdictional issues; \n\n(b) the question of judicial propriety; \n\n(c) the merits; \n\n(d) the legal consequences. \n\nBefore doing so  wish, however, to make some remarks about the background and context of the request. 
    \n\n3. In paragraph 54 of the Opinion the Court observes (in the context of judicial propriety) that it is aware that the question of the wall is part of a greater whole but that that cannot be a reason for it to decline to reply to the question asked. It adds that this wider context will be care- fully taken into account.  fully share the Court's view as laid down in that paragraph including the Court's observation that it can nevertheless only examine other issues to the extent that is necessary for the con- sideration of the question put to it. 
    \n\n4. In my opinion the Court could and should have given more explicit attention to the general context of the request in its Opinion. The situation in and around Palestine has been for a number of decades not only a virtually continuous threat to international peace and security but also a human tragedy which in many respects is mind-boggling. How can a society like the Palestinian one get used to and live with a situation where the victims of violence are often innocent men, women and children'? How can a society like the Israeli society get used to and live with a situation where attacks against a political opponent are targeted at innocent civilians, men, women and children, in an indiscriminate way? 
    \n\n5. The construction of the wall is explained by Israel as a necessary protection against the latter category of acts which are generally considered to be international crimes. Deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians with the intention to kill are the core element of terror- ism which has been unconditionally condemned by the international community regardless of the motives which have inspired them. Every State, including Israel, has the right and even the duty (as the Court says in paragraph 141) to respond to such acts in order to protect the life of its citizens, albeit the choice of means in doing so is limited by the norms and rules of international law. In the present case, Israel has not respected those limits, and the Court convincingly demonstrates that these norms and rules of international law have not been respected by it. i find no fault with this conclusion nor with the finding that the construction of the wall along the chosen route has greatly added to the suffering of the Palestinians living in the Occupied Territory. 
    \n\n6. In paragraph 122 the Court finds that the construction of the wall, along with measures taken earlier, severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination, and therefore constitutes a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right. i have doubts whether the last part of that finding is correct (see paragraph 32, below), but it is beyond doubt that the mere existence of a structure that sepa- rates the Palestinians from each other makes the realization of their right to self-determination far more difficult. even if it has to be admitted that the realization of this right is more dependent upon political agreement than on the situation in loco. But it is also true that the terrorist acts themselves have caused great harm to the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a better future, as was stated in the Middle East Quartet Statement of 16 July 2002. And the Statement continues: Terrorists must not be allowed to kill the hope of an entire region, and a united international community, for genuine peace and security for both Palestinians and Israelis. (Written Statement of Israel, Annex 10.) 
    \n\n7. The fact that the Court has limited itself to report merely on a number of the historical facts which have led to the present human tragedy may be correct from the viewpoint of what is really needed to answer the request of the General Assembly: the result, however, is that the historical résumé, as presented in paragraphs 70 to 78, is rather two- dimensional. i will illustrate this by giving one example which is hardly relevant for the case itself. 
    \n\n8. Before giving its historical résumé, the Court says that it will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory and it starts by mentioning the establishment of the Mandate after the First World War. Nothing is said, however, about the status of the West Bank between the conclusion of the General Armistice Agreement in 1949 and the occupation by Israel in 1967, in spite of the fact that it is a generally known factthat it was placed by Jordan under its sovereignty but that this claim to sovereignty, which was relinquished only in 1988, was recognized by three States only. 
    \n\n9. i fail to understand the reason for this omission of an objective historical fact since in my view the fact that Jordan claimed sovereignty over the West Bank only strengthens the argument in favour of the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention right from the moment of its occupation by Israel in June 1967. If it is correct that the Government of Israel claims that the Fourth Geneva Convention is not applicable de jure in the West Bank since that territory had not previously to the 1967 war been under Jordanian sovereignty, that argument already fails since a territory, which by one of the parties to an armed conflict is claimed as its own and is under its control, is - once occupied by the other party - by definition occupied territory of a High Contracting Party in the sense of the Fourth Geneva Convention (emphasis added). And both Israel and Jordan were parties to the Convention. \n\nThat this at the time also was recognized by the Israeli authorities is borne out by the Order issued after the occupation and referred to in paragraph 93 of the Opinion. 
    \n\n10. The strange result of the Court's reticence about the status of the West Bank between 1949 and 1967 is that it is only by implication that the reader is able to understand that it was under Jordanian control (paragraphs 73 and 129 refer to the demarcation line between Israel and Jordan (the Green Line)) without ever being explicitly informed that the West Bank had been placed under Jordanian authority. This is all the more puzzling as the Court would in no way have been compelled to comment on the legality or legitimacy of that authority if it had made  mention of it. 
    \n\n11. In a letter of 29 January from the Deputy Director General and Legal Adviser of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Registrar of the Court it is stated that Israel trusts and expects that the Court will look beyond the request to the wider issues relevant to this matter (Written Statement of Israel, covering letter). In this respect it was said that resolution ES-10114 is absolutely silent on the terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens and thus reflects the gravest prejudice and imbalance with the requesting organ. Israel, therefore, requested the Court not to render the opinion. 
    \n\n12. i am of the view that the Court, in deciding whether it is appropriate to respond to a request for an advisory opinion, can involve itself with the political debate which has preceded the request only to the extent necessary to understand the question put. It is no exception that such debate is heated but, as the Court said in the case of the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons.once the Assembly has asked, by adopting a resolution, for an advisory opinion on a legal question, the Court, in determining whether there are any compelling reasons for it to refuse to give such an opinion, will not have regard to the origins or to the political history of the request, or to the distribution of votes in respect of the adopted resolution (I. C.J. Reports 1996 (I), p. 237, para. 16). The Court, however, does not function in a void. It is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and has to carry out its function and responsibility within the wider political context. It cannot be expected to present a legal opinion on the request of a political organ without taking full account of the context in which the request was made. 
    \n\n13. Although the Court certainly has taken into account the arguments put forward by Israel and has dealt with them in a considerate manner, i am of the view that the present Opinion could have reflected in a more satisfactory way the interests at stake for all those living in the region. The rather oblique references to terrorist acts which can be Sound at several places in the Opinion are in my view not sufficient for this purpose. An advisory opinion is brought to the attention of a political organ of the United Nations and is destined to have an effect on a political process. It should therefore throughout its reasoning and up till the operative part reflect the legitimate interests and responsibilities of all those involved and not merely refer to them in a concluding paragraph (para. 162). 
    \n\n14. i fully share the view of the Court that the adoption of resolution ES-10114 was not ultra vires since it did not contravene the provision of Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter; nor did it fail to fulfil the essential conditions set by the Uniting for Peace resolution (resolution 377 A (V)) for the convening of an Emergency Special Session. 
    \n\n15. i doubt, however, whether it is possible to describe the practice of the political organs of the United Nations with respect to the interpretation of Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter without taking into account the effect of the Uniting for Peace resolution on this interpretation. In the Opinion, the Court deals with resolution 377 A (V) as a sepa- rate item and merely in relation to its procedural requirements. In my opinion this resolution also had a more substantive effect, namely with regard to the interpretation of the relationship between the competences of the Security Council and the General Assembly respectively, in the field of international peace and security and has certainly expedited  the development of the interpretation of the condition, contained in Article 12, paragraph 1, namely that the Assembly shall not make a recommendation with regard to a dispute or situation while the Security Council is exercising its functions in respect of such dispute or situation (emphasis added). 
    \n\n16. This effect is also recognized in doctrine. The adoption of the 'Uniting for Peace' resolution ... could not fail to have an effect on the weight to be given to the restriction in Article 12, paragraph 1. (Philippe Manin, in J.-P. Cot, La Charte des Nations Unies, 2nd ed., 1981, p. 298 translation by the Registry; see also E. de Wet, The Chapter VII Powers of' the United Nations Security Council, 2004, p. 46.) In actual practice the adoption of the Uniting for Peace resolution has contributed to the interpretation that, if a veto cast by a permanent member prevents the Security Council from taking a decision, the latter is no longer considered to be exercising its functions within the meaning of Article 12, paragraph 1. And the fact that a veto had been cast when the Security Council voted on a resolution dealing with the construction of the wall is determinative for the conclusion that the Security Council was no longer exercising its functions under the Charter with respect to the construction of the wall. In the present case, therefore, the conclusion that resolution ES-10114 did not contravene Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter cannot be dissociated from the effect resolution 377 A (V) has had on the interpretation of that provision. 
    \n\n17. That such practice is accepted by both Assembly and Security Council also with regard to the procedural requirements of resolution 377 A (V) is borne out by the fact that none of the Council's members considered that the reconvening of the Assembly in Emergency Special Session on 20 October 2003 was unconstitutional and that the adoption of the resolution demanding that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall was therefore ultra vires. In this respect it is telling that this resolution (resolution ES-10113) was tabled as a compromise by the Presidency of the European Union, among whose members were two permanent and two non-permanent members of the Security Council, less than a week after a draft resolution on the same subject had been vetoed in the Council. 
    \n\n18. Let me add that i agree with the Court that there has developed a practice enabling the General Assembly and the Security Council to deal in parallel with the same matter concerning the maintenance of international peace and security. I doubt, however, whether a resolution of the character of resolution ES-10113 (which beyond any doubt is a recommendation in the sense of Article 12, paragraph 1) could have been law- fully adopted by the Assembly, whether in a regular session or in an Emergency Special Session, if the Security Council had been considering the specific issue of the construction of the wall without yet having taken a decision.
    \n\n19. I must confess that i have felt considerable hesitation as to whether it would be judicially proper to comply with the request of the Assembly. 
    \n\n20. This hesitation had first of all to do with the question whether the Court would not be unduly politicized by giving the requested advisory opinion, thereby undermining its ability to contribute to global security and to respect for the rule of law. It must be admitted that such an opinion, whatever its content, will inevitably become part of an already heated political debate. The question is in particular pertinent as three members of the Quartet (the United States, the Russian Federation and the European Union) abstained on resolution ES-10114 and do not seem too eager to see the Court complying with the request out of fear that the opinion may interfere with the political peace process. Such fears cannot be taken lightly since the situation concerned is a continuous danger for international peace and security and a source of immense human suffering. 
    \n\n21. While recognizing that the risk of a possible politicization is real, I nevertheless concluded that this risk would not be neutralized by a refusal to give an opinion. The risk should have been a consideration for the General Assembly when it envisaged making the request. Once the decision to do so had been taken, the Court was made an actor on the political stage regardless of whether it would or would not give an opinion. A refusal would just as much have politicized the Court as the rendering of an opinion. Only by limiting itself strictly to its judicial function is the Court able to minimize the risk that its credibility in upholding the respect for the rule of law is affected. 
    \n\n22. My hesitation was also related to the question of the object of the Assembly's request. What was the Assembly's purpose in making the request? Resolution ES-10114 seems to give some further information in this respect in its last preambular paragraph which reads as follows: Bearing in mind that the passage of time further compounds the difficulties on the ground, as Israel, the occupying Power, continues to refuse to comply with international law vis-à-vis its construction of the above-mentioned wall, with all its detrimental implications and consequences ... Evidently the Assembly finds it necessary to take speedy action to bring to an end these detrimental implications and consequences and for this purpose it needs the views of the Court. But the question remains: Views on what? And why the views of a judicial body on an act which has already been determined not to be in conformity with international law and the perpetrator of which has already been called upon to terminate and reverse its wrongful conduct (resolution ES-10/13)? 
    \n\n23. The present request recalls the dilemma as seen by Judge Petrén in the Namibia case. He felt that the purpose of the request for an advisory opinion was in that case above all to obtain from the Court a reply such that States would find themselves under obligation to bring to bear on South Africa pressure ... He called this a reversal of the natural distribution of roles as between the principal judicial organ and the political organ of the United Nations since, instead of asking the Court its opinion on a legal question in order to deduce the political consequences following from it, the opposite was done (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 /1970), Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 128). 
    \n\n24. In the present Opinion the Court responds to the argument that the Assembly has not made clear what use it would make of an advisory opinion on the wall, with a reference to the Nuclear Weapons case where it said that it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide whether or not an advisory opinion is needed by the Assembly for the performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own needs. (Para. 61.) And the Court continues that it cannot substitute its assessment of the usefulness of the opinion requested for that of the organ that seeks such opinion, namely the General Assembly (para. 62). 
    \n\n25. I do not consider this answer fully satisfactory. There is quite a difference between substituting the Court's assessment of the usefulness of the opinion for that of the organ requesting it and analysing from a judicial viewpoint what the purpose of the request is. The latter is a simple necessity in order to find out what the Court as a judicial body is in a position to say. And from that point of view the request is phrased in a way which can be called odd, to put it mildly. And in actual fact the Court makes this analysis when in paragraph 39 of the Opinion it says that the use of the terms legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall necessarily encompasses an assessment of whether that construction is or is not in breach of certain rules and principles of international law. I agree with that statement but not because the word necessarily is related to the terms of the request but because it is related to the judicial responsibility of the Court. To quote the words of Judge Dillard in the Namibia case: when these [political] organs do see fit to ask for an advisory opinion, they must expect the Court to act in strict accordance with its judicial function. This function precludes it from accepting, without any enquiry whatever, a legal conclusion which itself conditions the nature and scope of the legal consequences flowing from it. It would be otherwise if the resolutions requesting an opinion were legally neutral ... (I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 15 1; emphasis added.)
    \n\n26. In the present case the request is far from being legally neutral. In order not to be precluded, from the viewpoint of judicial propriety, from rendering the opinion, the Court therefore is duty bound to recon- sider the content of the request in order to uphold its judicial dignity. The Court has done so but in my view it should have done so proprio motu and not by assuming what the Assembly necessarily must have assumed, something it evidently did not. 
    \n\n27. Let me add that in other respects i share the views the Court has expressed with regard to the issue of judicial propriety. In particular the Court's finding that the subject-matter of the General Assembly cannot be regarded as being only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine (para. 49) is in my view worded in a felicitous way since, in regard to the issue of the existence of a bilateral dispute, it avoids the dilemma of either / or. A situation which is of legitimate concern to the organized international community and a bilateral dispute with regard to that same situation may exist simultaneously. The existence of the latter cannot deprive the organs of the organized community of the competence which has been assigned to them by the constitutive instruments. In the present case the involvement of the United Nations in the question of Palestine is a long-standing one and, as the Court says, the subject-matter of the request is of acute concern to the United Nations (para. 50). By giving an opinion the Court therefore in no way circumvents the principle of con- sent to the judicial settlement of a bilateral dispute which exists simultaneously. The bilateral dispute cannot be dissociated from the subject- matter of the request, but only in very particular circumstances which cannot be spelled out in general can its existence be seen as an argument for the Court to decline to reply to the request. In this respect, 1 find the quotation from the Western Sahara Opinion in paragraph 47 of the Opinion, which contains pure circular reasoning, less than helpful. 
    \n\n28. If the request has been legitimately made in view of the United Nations long-standing involvement with the question of Palestine, Israel's argument that the Court does not have at its disposal the necessary evidentiary material, as this is to an important degree in the hands of Israel as a party to the dispute, does not hold water. The Court has to respect Israel's choice not to address the merits, but it is the Court's own responsibility to assess whether the available information is sufficient to enable it to give the requested opinion. And, although it is a matter for sincere regret that Israel has decided not to address the merits, the Court is right when it concludes that the available material allows it to give the opinion. 
    \n\n29. I share the Court's view that the 1907 Hague Regulations, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, the 1966 Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that Israel by constructing the wall and establishing the associated régime has breached its obligation under certain provisions of each of these conventions. i find no fault with the Court's reasoning in this respect although i regret that the summary of the Court's findings in paragraph 137 does not contain a list of treaty provisions which have been breached. 
    \n\n30. The Court has refrained from taking a position with regard to territorial rights and the question of permanent status. It has taken note of statements, made by Israeli authorities on various occasions, that the fence is a temporary measure, that it is not a border and that it does not change the legal status of the territory. i wellcome these assurances which may be seen as the recognition of legal commitments on the side of Israel but share the Court's concern that the construction of the wall creates a fait accompli. It is therefore all the more important to expedite the political process which has to settle all territorial and permanent status issues. 
    \n\n31. Self-determination - In my view, it would have been better if the Court had also left issues of self-determination to this political process. i fully recognize that the right of self-determination is one of the basic principles of modern international law and that the realization of this right for the people of Palestine is one of the most burning issues for the solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The overriding aim of the political process, as it is embodied inter alia in the Roadmap, is the emergence of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neigh- bours (dossier of the Secretary-General, No. 70). This goal is subscribed to by both Israel and Palestine; both are, therefore, in good faith bound to desist from acts which may jeopardize this common interest. 
    \n\n32. The right of self-determination of the Palestinian people is there- fore imbedded in a much wider context than the construction of the wall and has to find its realization in this wider context. I readily agree with the Court that the wall and its associated régime impede the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination be it only for the reason that the wall establishes a physical separation of the people entitled to enjoy this right. But not every impediment to the exercise of a right is by definition a breach of that right or of the obligation to respect it, as the Court seems to conclude in paragraph 122. As was said by the Quartet in its statement of 16 July 2002, the terrorist attacks (and the failure of the Palestinian Authority to prevent them) cause also great harm to the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and thus seriously impede the realization of the right of self-determination. is that also a breach of that right? And if so, by whom? In my view the Court could not have concluded that Israel had committed a breach of its obligation to respect the Palestinians' right to self-determination without further legal analysis. 
    \n\n33. In this respect i do not find the references to earlier statements of the Court in paragraph 88 of the Opinion very enlightening. In the Namibia case the Court referred in specific terms to the relations between the inhabitants of a mandate and the mandatory as reflected in the constitutive instruments of the mandate system. In the East Timor case the Court called the rights of peoples to self-determination in a colonial situation a right ergu omnes, therefore a right opposable to all. But it said nothing about the way in which this right must be translated into obligations for States which are not the colonial Power. And I repeat the question: is every impediment to the exercise of the right to self-determination a breach of an obligation to respect it? Is it so only when it is serious? Would the discontinuance of the impeding act restore the right or merely bring the breach to an end? 
    \n\n34. Proportionality - The Court finds that the conditions set out in the qualifying clauses in the applicable humanitarian law and human rights conventions have not been met and that the measures taken by Israel cannot be justified by military exigencies or by requirements of national security or public order (paras. 135-137). I agree with that finding but in my opinion the construction of the wall should also have been put to the proportionality test, in particular since the concepts of military necessity and proportionality have always been intimately linked in international humanitarian law. And in my view it is of decisive importance that, even if the construction of the wall and its associated régime could be justified as measures necessary to protect the legitimate rights of Israeli citizens, these measures would not pass the proportionality test. The route chosen for the construction of the wall and the ensuing disturbing consequences for the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory are manifestly disproportionate to interests which Israel seeks to protect, as seems to be recognized also in recent decisions of the Israeli Supreme Court. 
    \n\n35. Self - defence - Israel based the construction of the wall on its inherent right of self-defence as contained in Article 51 of the Charter. In this respect it relied on Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), adopted after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 against targets located in the United States. The Court starts its response to this argument by stating that Article 51 recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of an armed attack by one State against another State (para. 139). Although this statement is undoubtedly correct, as a reply to Israel's argument it is, with all due respect, beside the point. Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) recognize the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence without making any reference to an armed attack by a State. The Security Council called acts of international terrorism, without any further qualification, a threat to international peace and security which authorizes it to act under Chapter VII of the Charter. And it actually did so in resolution 1373 (2001) without ascribing these acts of terrorism to a particular State. This is the completely new element in these resolutions. This new element is not excluded by the terms of Article 51 since this conditions the exercise of the inherent right of self-defence on a previous armed attack without saying that this armed attack must come from another State even if this has been the generally accepted interpretation for more than 50 years. The Court has regrettably by-passed this new element, the legal implications of which cannot as yet be assessed but which marks undeniably a new approach to the concept of self-defence. 
    \n\n36. The argument which in my view is decisive for the dismissal of Israel's claim that it is merely exercising its right of self-defence can be found in the second part of paragraph 139. The right of self-defence as contained in the Charter is a rule of international law and thus relates to international phenomena. Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) refer to acts of international terrorism as constituting a threat to international peace and security; they therefore have no immediate bearing on terrorist acts originating within a territory which is under control of the State which is also the victim of these acts. And Israel does not claim that these acts have their origin elsewhere. The Court therefore rightly concludes that the situation is different from that contemplated by resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) and that consequently Article 51 of the Charter cannot be invoked by Israel.  
    \n\n37. i have voted in favour of subparagraph (3) (B), (C) and (E) of the operative part. I agree with the Court's finding with regard to the consequences of the breaches by Israel of its obligations under international law for Israel itself and for the United Nations (paras. 149-153 and 160). Since i have voted, however, against operative subparagraph (3) (D), the remainder of my opinion will explain the reasons for my dissent in a more detailed way than i did in my introductory remarks. 
    \n\n38. The General Assembly requests the Court to specify what are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall. If the object of the request is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions (para. 50) it is only logical that a specific paragraph of the dispositif is addressed to the General Assembly. That the paragraph is also addressed to the Security Council is logical as well in view of the shared or parallel responsibilities of the two organs. Since the Court has found that the construction of the wall and the associated régime constitute breaches of Israel's obligations under inter- national law, it is also logical that the Court spells out what are the legal consequences for Israel. 
    \n\n39. Although the Court beyond any doubt is entitled to do so, the request itself does not necessitate (not even by implication) the determination of the legal consequences for other States, even if a great number of participants urged the Court to do so (para. 146). In this respect the situation is completely different from that in the Namibia case where the question was exclusively focused on the legal consequences for States, and logically so since the subject-matter of the request was a decision by the Security Council. 
    \n\nIn the present case there must therefore be a special reason for deter- mining the legal consequences for other States since the clear analogy in wording with the request in the Namibia case is insufficient. 
    \n\n40. That reason as indicated in paragraphs 155 to 158 of the Opinion is that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnes. I must admit that i have considerable difficulty in understanding why a violation of an obligation ergu omnes by one State should necessarily lead to an obligation for third States. The nearest i can come to such an explanation is the text of Article 41 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility. That Article reads: \n\n1. States shall cooperate to bring to an end through lawful means any serious breach within the meaning of article 40. Article 40 deals with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of general international law.\n\n2. No State shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach within the meaning of article 40, nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation. Paragraph 3 of Article 41 is a saving clause and of no relevance for the present case. 
    \n\n41. I will not deal with the tricky question whether obligations ergu omnes can be equated with obligations arising under a peremptory norm of general international law. In this respect i refer to the useful commentary of the ILC under the heading of Chapter III of its Articles. For argument's sake i start from the assumption that the consequences of the violation of such obligations are identical. "

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).
    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE AL-KHASAWNEH
    \n\n1.I concur with the Court's findings and agree in general with its reasoning. Certain salient points in the Advisory Opinion merit some elucidation and it is specifically with regard to those points that I append this opinion. 
    \n\n2. Few propositions in international law can be said to command an almost universal acceptance and to rest on a long, constant and solid  opinio juris as the proposition that Israel's presence in the Palestinian  territory of the West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza is one of  military occupation governed by the applicable international legal régime of military occupation.
    \n\n3. In support of this, one may cite the very large number of resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly often unanimously  or by overwhelming majorities, including binding decisions of the Council and other resolutions which, while not binding, nevertheless produce legal effects and indicate a constant record of the international community's opinio juris. In al1 of these resolutions the territory in question was unfalteringly characterized as occupied territory; Israel's  presence in it as that of a military occupant and Israel's compliance or non-compliance with its obligations towards the territory and its inhabitants measured against the objective yardstick of the protective norms of humanitarian law.  
    \n\n4. Similarly the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention  and the International Cornmittee of the Red Cross have retained their consensus that the convention, i.e. the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949, does apply de jure to the occupied territories '.
    \n\n5. This has also been the position of States individually or in groups including States friendly to Israel. Indeed a review of the record would reveal that, as noted by France in its Written Statement:  \n\nIsrael initially recognized the applicability of the Fourth Convention:  according to Article 35 of Order No. 1, issued by the occupying authorities on 7 June 1967 [translation by the Registry], '[tlhe  Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva Convention dated 12 August 1949, Relative to the Protection of Civilians in Time of War, with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and said Convention, the Convention shall prevail ...' (P. 7.) 
    \n\n6. More recently Israel's Supreme Court has confirmed the applicability  of the Fourth Geneva Convention to those territories.
    \n\n7. Whilst that consistent record of the international community's opinio juris cannot just be swept aside and ignored, the Court did not  simply reiterate that opinio juris, instead, while taking cognizance of it, the Court arrived at similar conclusions regarding the de jure applicability  of the Fourth Geneva Convention mainly on the basis of a textual interpretation of the Convention itself (paras. 86-101). Paragraph 101 reads:  \n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n8. The Court followed a wise course in steering away from embarking on an enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories not only because such an enquiry is unnecessary for the purpose of establishing their present status as occupied territories and affirming the de jure  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to them, but also because the prior status of the territories would make no difference whatsoever to their present status as occupied territories except in the event that they were terra nu1lius when they were occupied by Israel, which no one would seriously argue given that that discredited concept is of no contemporary application, besides being incompatible with the territories' status as a former mandatory territory regarding which, as the Court had occasion to pronounce two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of... peoples not yet able to govern themselves formed 'a sacred trust of civilization' (International Status of South West Africa, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 131). 
    \n\n9. Whatever the merits and demerits of the Jordanian title in the West Bank might have been, and Jordan would in al1 probability argue that its title there was perfectly valid and internationally recognized and point out that it had severed its legal ties to those territories in favour of Palestinian self-determination, the fact remains that what prevents this right of self-determination from being fulfilled is Israel's prolonged military occupation with its policy of creating faits accomplis on the ground. In this regard it should be recalled that the principle of  non-annexation is not extinguished with the end of the mandate but subsists until it is realized. 
    \n\n10. There is no doubt that the Green Line was initially no more than an armistice line in an agreement that expressly stipulated that its  provisions would not be interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimatepolitical settlement between the Parties and that the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of the Agreement were agreedupon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements orboundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto (AdvisoryOpinion, para. 72).
    \n\n11. It is not without irony that prominent Israeli jurists were arguing before the 1967 war that the General Armistice agreements were sui generis, were in fact more than mere armistice agreements, could not be changed except with the acceptance of the Security Council. Whatever the true significance of that line today, two facts are indisputable:
    \n\n(1) The Green line, to quote Sir Arthur Watts, is the starting line from which is measured the extent of Israel's occupation of non-Israeli territory (CR 2004/3, p. 64, para. 35). There is no implication that the Green Line is to be a permanent frontier. \n\n(2) Attempts at denigrating the significance of the Green Line would in the nature of things work both ways. Israel cannot shed doubts upon the title of others without expecting its own title and the territorial expanse of that title beyond the partition resolution not to be called into question. Ultimately it is through stabilizing its legal  relationship with the Palestinians and not through constructing walls that its security would be assured.
    \n\n12. The Court has included a reference to the tragic situation in the Holy Land. A situation that can be brought to an end  only through implementation in good faith of all relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The 'Roadmap' approved by Security Council resolution 1515 (2003) represents the most recent of efforts to initiate negotiations to this end. (Advisory Opinion, para. 162.) 
    \n\n13. Whilst there is nothing wrong in calling on protagonists to negotiate in good faith with the aim of implementing Security Council resolutions and while recalling that negotiations have produced peace agreements that represent defensible schemes and have withstood the test oftime, no one should be oblivious that negotiations are a means to an endand cannot in themselves replace that end. The discharge of international \n\nobligations including erga omnes obligations cannot be made conditionalupon negotiations. Additionally, it is doubtful, with regard to the Roadmap, when consideration is had to the conditions of acceptance of thateffort, whether the meeting of minds necessary to produce mutual andreciprocal obligations exists. Be that as it may, it is of the utmost importance if these negotiations are not to produce non-principled solutions,that they be grounded in law and that the requirement of good faith betranslated into concrete steps by abstaining from creating faits accomplison the ground such as the building of the wall which cannot but prejudicethe outcome of those negotiations."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above).
    \n\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE OWADA 
    \n\n1. i concur with the conclusions of the Opinion of the Court both on the preliminary issues (jurisdiction and judicial propriety) and on most of the points belonging to the merits of the substantive issues involved. Nevertheless, not only have i some disagreements on certain specific points in the Opinion, but i have some serious reservations about the way the Court has proceeded in this case. While i acknowledge that the way in which the Court has proceeded with the present case has to a large extent been made inevitable under the somewhat extraordinary and unique circumstances of the case that are not always attributable to the responsibility of the Court, i feel it incumbent upon me to make my position clear, by pointing to some of the problematic aspects of the way in which the Court has proceeded in the present case. 
    \n\n2. The Court has reached its conclusions on the preliminary issues on jurisdiction and on judicial propriety of exercising this jurisdiction primarily on the basis of the statements put forward by the participants in the course of its written and oral proceedings. The reasons for the Court to arrive at these conclusions are set out in paragraphs 24-67. These, as such, raise no major disagreement on my part. However, i believe that the issue of jurisdiction and especially the issue of judicial propriety is a matter that the Court should examine, proprio motu if necessary, in order to ensure that it is not only right as a matter of law but also proper as a matter of judicial policy for the Court as a judicial body to exercise jurisdiction in the concrete context of the case. This means, at least to my mind, that the Court would be required to engage in an in-depth scrutiny of all aspects of the particular circumstances of the present case relevant to the consideration of the case, if necessary going beyond what has been argued by the participants. One of such aspects of the present case is the implication of the existence of a bilateral dispute in the subject-matter of the request for an advisory opinion. 
    \n\n3. The original Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice contained no express provisions relating to advisory jurisdiction. Only the Covenant of the League of Nations, in its Article 14, stipulated that the Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly. It was this provision that came to form the legal basis for the exercise of advisory function by the Permanent Court of International Justice. 
    \n\n4. While the purport of this provision according to the intention of the founding fathers of the League does not appear to have been entirely clear nor unified, one of the points that clearly emerge from the legislative history of the Covenant is that the purpose of the advisory function of the Permanent Court consisted from the beginning in aiding the League in the peaceful settlement of a concrete dispute before the Council of the League, in particular in the context of the procedures provided for in Articles 12 to 16 of the Covenant . 
    \n\n5. When the Rules of Court were drafted in 1922 following the establishment of the Permanent Court, four articles (71-74) were consecrated to advisory procedure. They affirmed the judicial character of the advisory function of the new Court and paved the way for the later fuller assimilation of advisory to contentious procedure2. Indeed, the Report of the Committee of the Permanent Court of International Justice, appointed on 2 September 1927, stated as follows: The Statute does not mention advisory opinions, but leaves to the Court the entire regulation of its procedure in the matter. The Court, in the exercise of this power, deliberately and advisedly assimilated its advisory procedure to its contentious procedure; and the results have abundantly justified its action. Such prestige as the Court to-day enjoys as a judicial tribunal is largely due to the amount of its advisory business and the judicial way in which it has dealt with such business. In reality, where there are ... contending parties, the difference between contentious cases and advisory cases is only nominal. The main difference is the way in which the case comes before the Court, and even this difference may virtually disappear, as it did in the Tunisian case. So the view that advisory opinions are not binding is more theoretical than real. (P. C.I.J., Series E, No. 4, p. 76.) 
    \n\n6. In fact, when the Permanent Court declined to exercise jurisdiction to give a requested advisory opinion in the Status of Eastern Careliu case (P.C. I. J., Series B, No. 5), the main rationale of this decision lay precisely on this point. The specific issue referred to the Court was whether Articles 10 and 11 of the Treaty of Peace between Finland and Russia of 19201 and the annexed Declaration of the Russian Delegation regarding the autonomy of Eastern Carelia, constitute engagements of an international character which place Russia under an obligation to Finland as to the carrying out of the provisions contained therein (ibid, p. 6). In other words, it arose in the context of a dispute between Finland and Russia involving this issue - a matter which Finland asked the League of Nations to take up. The Council in its resolution expressed its willingness to consider the question with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution if the two parties concerned agree (ibid, p. 23). it was, how- ever, due to the circumstances where the Russian Government declined the request from the Estonian Government for it to consent to submit the question to the Council in conformity with Article 17 of the Covenant (ibid., p. 24) and where the Finnish Government again brought the matter before the Council, that the Council decided to request the advisory opinion in question.  
    \n\n7. Against this background, the Permanent Court stated as follows to clarify its position: There has been some discussion as to whether questions for an advisory opinion, if they relate to matters which form the subject of a pending dispute between nations, should be put to the Court with- out the consent of the parties. It is unnecessary in the present case to deal with this topic. (P. C.I. J., Series B, No. 5, p. 27; emphasis added.) \n\nAfter making this point clear, the Permanent Court continued as follows : It follows from the above that the opinion which the Court has been requested to give bears on an actual dispute between Finland and Russia. As Russia is not Member of the League of Nations, the case is one under Article 17 of the Covenant ... the Members of the League ... having accepted the Covenant, are under the obligation resulting from the provisions of this part dealing with the pacificsettlement of international disputes. As concerns States not members of the League, the situation is quite different; they are not bound by the Covenant. The submission, therefore, of a dispute between them and a Member of the League for solution according to the method.~ provided for in the Covenant, could take place only by virtue of their consent. Such consent, however, has never been given by Russia. (P. C. I. J., Series B, No. 5, pp. 27-28; emphasis added.). It is clear from this passage that the main rationale of the Permanent Court in declining the exercise of jurisdiction in the Eastern Carelia case was not the existence of a dispute relating to the subject-matter of the request between the parties, but rather the fact that one of the parties to the dispute did not give its consent to a solution according to the methods provided for in the Covenant. 
    \n\n8. When the International Court of Justice was reconstituted as the institutional successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and incorporated into the United Nations system as its principal judicial organ, no drastic change was introduced in the new Statute of the Inter- national Court of Justice relating to its functions or to its constitution in this respect. Since then, the advisory function of the Court, as the secondary but important function of the Court, has been exercised by the Court in line with the course laid down by its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, in the days of the League as described above. 
    \n\n9. Given this background, and in light of the case law accumulated in the course of years since the establishment of the International Court of Justice on the questions of jurisdiction of the Court in advisory proceedings and of propriety of its exercise, it is my view that the Court is right in its conclusion in the present case that the existence of a dispute on a bilateral basis should not be a bar to the Court in giving the advisory opinion requested. 
    \n\n10. While the existence of a bilateral dispute thus should not exclude the Court from exercising jurisdiction in advisory proceedings as a matter of judicial propriety, however, it is my view that the existence of a bilat- eral dispute should be a factor to be taken into account by the Court in determining the extent to which, and the manner in which, the Court should exercise jurisdiction in such advisory proceedings. In this respect, i am of the view that the Court has drawn too facile an analogy between the present case and the past cases of advisory opinion and especially thecase concerning Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (19701, Advisory Opinion. Given the intricacies of the present case, i submit that this approach of applying the principles drawn from the past precedents automatically to the present situation is not quite warranted. 
    \n\n11. Especially in the Namibia case, the point in issue that formed the basis for the request for an advisory opinion was the legal consequences ... of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia ... notwithstanding Security Council resolution 276 (1970). In spite of the similarity in language in the formulation of the request, the basis for this request was very different from the present one. In the Namibia case, the Court was asked to give an opinion on the legal significance of the action taken by the United Nations in terminating the South African Mandate over South West Africa and its legal impact upon the status of South Africa in that territory. If there was a legal controversy or a dispute, it was precisely the one between the United Nations and the State concerned. By contrast, what is in issue in the present situation centres on a situation created by the action of Israel vis-i-vis Palestine in relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It is undeniable that there is in this case an underlying legal controversy or a dispute between the parties directly involved in this situation, while at the same time, as the Court correctly points out, it concerns a matter between the United Nations and Israel since the legal interest of the United Nations is legitimately involved. 
    \n\n12. This of course is not to sav that the Court should decline for this reason the exercise of jurisdiction in the present case. It does mean, how- ever, that the question of judicial propriety should be examined taking into account this reality, and on the basis of the jurisprudence in more pertinent cases. i believe the closest to the present case probably is the Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, case, in the sense the there was in that case clearly an underlying legal controversy or a dispute between the parties involved. However, even that case does not offer a completely analogous precedent, from which the Court can draw its conclusion. In the Western Sahara case, the Court stated: The object of the General Assembly has not been to bring before the Court, by way of a request for advisory opinion, a dispute or legal controversy, in order that it may later, on the basis of the Courts opinion, exercise its powers and functions for the peaceful settlement of that dispute or controversy. The object of the request is an entirely different one: to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance to it for the proper exercise of its functions concerning the decolonization of the territory. (Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1975, pp. 26-27, para. 39; emphasis added.) In the present case, the presumed objective of the General Assembly in requesting an advisory opinion would not seem to be the latter so much as the former in the two examples given in this passage. 
    \n\n13. Thus, acknowledging the fact that in the present case there is this undeniable aspect of an underlying legal controversy or a dispute between the parties involved, and keeping this aspect clearly in mind, i wish to state that the critical test for judicial propriety in exercising jurisdiction of the Court, which it undoubtedly has, should lie, not in whether the request is related to a concrete legal controversy or dispute in existence, but in whether to give a reply would have the effect of circumventing the principle that a State is not obliged to allow its disputes to be submitted to judicial settlement without its consent ( Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 25, para. 33; emphasis added). To put it differently, the critical criterion for judicial propriety in the final analysis should lie in the Court seeing to it that giving a reply in the form of an advisory opinion on the subject-matter of the request should not be tantamount to adjudicating on the very subject-matter of the underlying concrete bilateral dispute that currently undoubtedly exists between Israel and Palestine. 
    \n\n14. The reasoning that i have offered above leads me to the following two conclusions. First, the fact that the present case contains an aspect of addressing a bilateral dispute should not prevent the Court from exercising its competence. Second, however, this fact should have certain important bearing on the whole proceedings that the Court is to conduct in the present case, in the sense that the Court in the present advisory proceedings should focus its task on offering its objective findings of law to the extent necessary and useful to the requesting organ, the General Assembly, in carrying out its functions relating to this question, rather than adjudicating on the subject-matter of the dispute between the parties concerned. 
    \n\n15. It should be recalled that, even when deciding to exercise its advisory function, this Court has consistently maintained the position that it should remain faithful to the requirements of its judicial character. Thus in the Western Sahara case the Court declared: Article 65, paragraph 1, of the Statute, which establishes the power of the Court to give an advisory opinion, is permissive and, under it, that power is of a discretionary character. In exercising this discretion, the International Court of Justice, like the Permanent Court of International Justice, has always been guided by the principle that, us a judicial body, it is bound to remain faithful to the requirements of its judicial character even in giving advisory opinions.  (Advisory Opinion, I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 21, para. 23 ; emphasis added.)
    \n\n16. One of such requirements for the Court as a judicial body is the maintenance of fairness in its administration of justice in the advisory procedure in the midst of divergent positions and interests among the interested parties. To put it differently, it must be underlined that the Courts discretion in advisory matters is not limited to the question of whether to comply with a request. It also embraces questions of advisory procedure4 This requirement acquires a special importance in the present case, as we accept the undeniable fact as developed above that the present case does relate to an underlying concrete legal controversy or a dispute, despite my own conclusion that it is proper for the Court to exercise its jurisdiction in the present case. 
    \n\n17. Article 68 of the Statute of the Court prescribes that in the exercise of its advisory functions the Court shall further be guided by the pro- visions of the present Statute which apply in contentious cases to the extent to which it recognizes them to be applicable. The Rules of Court in Part IV (Arts. 102-109) elaborates this provision of the Statute. Particularly relevant in this context is Article 102, paragraph 3 of which provides that When an advisory opinion is requested upon a legal question actually pending between two or more States, Article 31 of the Statute shall apply, as also the provision of these Rules concerning the application of that Article. 
    \n\n18. In the Namibia case, South Africa made an application for the appointment of a judge ad hoc to sit in the proceedings in accordance with this provision. Although the Court in its Order of 29 January 1971 decided to reject this application (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 2 76 ( 1970), I. C. J. Reports 1971, p. 12), it was met with well-argued dissenting views on this point (ibid, p. 308; p. 324). By contrast, in the Western Sahara case the Court took a different position. In response to a request by Morocco for the appointment of a judge ad hoc in accordance with Article 89 (Le., present Article 102) of the Rules of Court, the Court found that Morocco was entitled to choose a judge ad hoc in the proceedings (a similar request by Mauritania on the other hand was rejected) (I. C. J. Reports 1975, p. 6). 
    \n\n19. The procedure for the appointment of a judge ad hoc is set in motion by the application of a State which claims that the request for the advisory opinion relates to a legal question actually pending between two or more States (Rules of Court, Art. 102). It is my view that in light of the precedents noted above, Israel in its special position in the present case would have been justified in making an application to choose a judgead hoc. For whatever reason, Israel did not choose this course of action. If it had done so, the task of the Court in maintaining the essential requirement for fairness in the administration of justice would have been greatly enhanced. It goes without saying that such a course of action would have complicated the situation, due to the fact that the other party to this dispute, Palestine, is an entity which is not recognized as a State for the purpose of the Statute of the Court. What would happen then if one of the parties directly interested is in a position of appointing a judge ad hoc, while the other is not. Fairness in the administration of justice could be questioned from this angle. While i do not propose to offer my own conclusion to this intractable but hypothetical problem, what i wish to point out is that this factor is one of the important aspects of the present case that could have been considered by the Court in deciding on the question of judicial propriety of whether, and if so how far, the Court should exercise its jurisdiction in the unique circumstances of this case. 
    \n\n20. Be that as it may, it is established that even in contentious proceedings the absence of one of the parties in itself does not deprive the Court of its jurisdiction to proceed (Statute of the Court, Art. 53), but that the Court has to maintain its fairness in the administration of justice as a court of justice. Thus, in relation to the question of the law to be proved and applied, the Court stated in the cases concerning Fisheries Jurisdiction as follows : The Court ..., as an international judicial organ, is deemed to take judicial notice of international law and is therefore required in a case falling under Article 53 of the Statute, as in any other case, to consider on its own initiative all rules of international law which may be relevant to the settlement of the dispute. It being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court. (Merits, Judgment, I. C. J. Reports 1974, p. 181, para. 18.) In relation to the question of the facts to be clarified, the Court in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua V. United States of America) stated that: in principle it is not bound to confine its consideration to the material formally submitted to it by the parties (cf. Brazilian Loans, P. C. I. J., Series A, No. 20121, p. 124; Nuclear Tests, I. C. J. Reports 1974, pp. 263-264, paras. 31, 32) (Merits, Judgment, I. C. J. Reports 1986, p. 25, para. 30). It went on to state as follows: The Court has thus to strike a balance. On the one hand, it is valuable for the Court to know the views of both parties in whateverform those views may have been expressed. Further, as the Court noted in 1974, where one party is not appearing it is especially incumbent upon the Court to satisfy itself that it is in possession of all the available facts (Nuclear Tests, I. C.J. Reports 1974, p. 263, para. 31 ; p. 468, para. 32.). On the other hand, the Court has to emphasize that the equality of the parties to the dispute must remain the basic principle for the Court. (I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 25-26, para. 31 .)
    \n\n21. This principle governing the basic position of the Court should be applicable to advisory proceedings as it is applicable to contentious proceedings. Indeed, it may even be arguable that this principle is applicable a fortiori to advisory proceedings, in the sense that in advisory proceedings as distinct from contentious proceedings it cannot be said, at any rate in the legal sense, that the absent party ... forfeits the opportunity to counter the factual allegations of its opponent (Military und Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1986, p. 25, para. 30). In advisory proceedings no State, however interested a party it may be, is under the obligation to appear before the Court to present its case. 
    \n\n22. On this point of facts and information relating to the present case, it is undoubtedly true, as the present Opinion States, that the Court has at its disposal the report of the Secretary-General, as well as a voluminous dossier submitted by him to the Court, com- prising not only detailed information on the route of the wall but also on its humanitarian and socio-economic impact on the Palestinian population (Advisory Opinion, para. 57). Indeed, there is ample material, in particular, about the humanitarian and socio-economic impacts of the construction of the wall. Their authenticity and reliability are not in doubt. What seems to be wanting, how- ever, is the material explaining the Israeli side of the picture, especially in the context of why and how the construction of the wall as it is actually planned and implemented is necessary and appropriate. 
    \n\n23. This, to my mind, would seem to be the case, in spite of the Courts assertion that Israel's Written Statement, although limited to issues of jurisdiction and propriety, contained observations on other matters, including Israel's concerns in terms of security, and was accompanied by corresponding annexes (Advisory Opinion, para. 57). In fact my point would seem to be corroborated by what the present Opinion itself acknowledges in relation to the argument of Israel on this issue. Israel has argued that the walls sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank, or as the report of the Secretary-General puts it, to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank (Advisory Opinion, para. 80). However, the Court, in paragraph 137 of the Opinion, simply states that from the material available to it, it is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives (emphasis added). It seems clear to me that here the Court is in effect admitting the fact that elaborate material on this point from the Israeli side is not available, rather than engaging in a rebuttal of the arguments of Israel on the basis of the material that might have been made available by Israel on this point. Again in paragraph 140 of the Opinion, the Court bases itself simply on the material before it to express ifs lack of conviction that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction. 
    \n\n24. In raising this point, it is not my purpose to dispute the factual accuracy of these assertions, or to question the conclusions arrived at on the basis of the documents and the material available to the Court. In fact it would seem reasonable to conclude on balance that the political, social, economic and humanitarian impacts of the construction of the wall, as substantiated by ample evidence supplied and documented in the course of the present proceedings, is such that the construction of the wall would constitute a violation of international obligations under various international instruments to which Israel is a Party. Furthermore, these impacts are so overwhelming that i am ready to accept that no justification based on the military exigencies, even if fortified by substantiated facts, could conceivably constitute a valid basis for precluding the wrongfulness of the act on the basis of the stringent conditions of proportionality. 
    \n\n25. However, that is not the point. What is crucial is that the above samples of quotations from the present Opinion testify to my point that the Court, once deciding to exercise jurisdiction in this case, should be extremely careful not only in ensuring the objective fairness in the result, but in seeing to it that the Court is seen to maintain fairness throughout the proceedings, whatever the final conclusion that we come to may be in the end.  
    \n\n26. The question put to the Court for its advisory opinion is the specific question of the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel (General Assembly resolution AIES-101 L.16). It concerns only that specific act of Israel. Needless to say, how- ever, the Israeli construction of the wall has not come about in a vacuum; it is a part, albeit an extremely important part, of the whole picture of the situation surrounding the peace in the Middle East with its long history. 
    \n\n27. Naturally, this does not alter the fact that the request for an advisory opinion is focused on a specific question and that the Court should treat this question, and this question only, without expanding the scopeof its enquiry into the bigger question relating to the peace in the Middle East, including issues relating to the permanent status of the territories involved. Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of getting to an objective truth concerning the specific question of the construction of the wall in its complete picture and of ensuring fairness in the administration of justice  in this case which involves the element of a dispute between parties directly involved, it seems of cardinal importance that the Court examine this specific question assigned to the Court, keeping in balance the overall picture which has formed the entire background of the construction of the wall.
    \n\n28. It has always been an undisputed premise of the peace in the Middle East that the twin principles of withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the 1967 conflict and termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force have to form the basis of the peace. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has consecrated these principles in so many words. The Roadmap, endorsed by Security Council resolution 1515 (2003), is a blueprint for proceeding on the basis of these principles. 
    \n\n29. If the Court found that the construction of the wall would go counter to this principle by impeding and prejudicing the realization of the principles, especially in the context of the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (Advisory Opinion, para. 117), it should state this. At the same time, the Court should remind the General Assembly that this was a principle couched in the context of the twin set of principles, both of which would have to be realized, at any rate in the context of a peace in the Middle East, side by side with each other. 
    \n\n30. As observed above, Israel has argued that the walls sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. In response to this, the Court has confined itself to stating that In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction. (Advisory Opinion, para. 140.) \n\nIt is certainly understood that the material available has not included an elaboration on this point, and that in the absence of such material the Court has found no other way for responding to this situation. It may also be accepted that this argument of Israel, even if acknowledged as true as far as the Israeli motives were concerned, would not be a sufficient ground for justifying the construction of the wall as it has actually been drawn up and implemented. As the Court has demonstrated with a high degree of persuasiveness, the construction of the wall would still constitute a breach of Israel's obligations, inter alia, under the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, unless cogent justifications are advanced for precluding the wrongfulness of this act. But the important point is that an in-depth effort could have been made by the Court, proprio motu, to ascertain the validity of this argument on the basis of facts and law, and to present an objective picture surrounding the construction of the wall in its entirety, on the basis of which to assess the merits of the contention of Israel. 
    \n\n31. It is to my mind important in this context that the issue of mutual resort to indiscriminate violence against civilian population should be looked at. Without going into the question of what is the causal relation- ship between the tragic acts of mutual violence resorted to by each of the parties and the question of whether the so-called terrorist attacks by Palestinian suicide bombers against the Israeli civilian population should be blamed as constituting a good enough ground for justifying the construction of the wall, i believe it is beyond dispute that this tragic circle of indiscriminate violence perpetrated by both sides against innocent civilian population of each other is to be condemned and rejected as totally unacceptable. While it is true that this is not an issue expressly referred to as part of the specific question put to the Court, i believe it should only be natural that this factor be underlined as an important segment of the Opinion of the Court in dealing with the issue of the construction of the wall. This point to my mind is of particular relevance from the viewpoint that the Court should approach the subject-matter in a balanced way."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "texto": "Question: The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.\n\n66. The Court will now address the question put to it by the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/14. The Court recalls that the question is as follows:\n\n\"What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?\"\n\n67. As explained in paragraph 82 below, the \"wall\" in question is a complex construction, so that that term cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel (\"fence\") or by the Secretary-General (\"barrier\"), are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense. In this Opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe Court notes furthermore that the request of the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the wall being built \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem\". As also explained below (see paragraphs 79-84 below), some parts of the complex are being built, or are planned to be built, on the territory of Israel itself; the Court does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legal consequences arising from the construction of those parts of the wall.\n\n68. The question put by the General Assembly concerns the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, in order to indicate those consequences to the General Assembly the Court must first determine whether or not the construction of that wall breaches international law (see paragraph 39 above). It will therefore make this determination before dealing with the consequences of the construction.\n\n69. To do so, the Court will first make a brief analysis of the status of the territory concerned, and will then describe the works already constructed or in course of construction in that territory. It will then indicate the applicable law before seeking to establish whether that law has been breached.\n\n70. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the First World War, a class \"A\" Mandate for Palestine was entrusted to Great Britain by the League of Nations, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Covenant, which provided that:\n\n\"Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.\"\n\nThe Court recalls that in its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South West Africa, speaking of mandates in general, it observed that \"The Mandate was created, in the interest of the inhabitants of the territory, and of humanity in general, as an international institution with an international object - a sacred trust of civilization.\" (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 132.) The Court also held in this regard that \"two principles were considered to be of paramount importance: the principle of non-annexation and the principle that the well-being and development of ... peoples [not yet able to govern themselves] formed a sacred trust of civilization\" (ibid., p. 131).\n\nThe territorial boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine were laid down by various instruments, in particular on the eastern border by a British memorandum of 16 September 1922 and an Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 20 February 1928.\n\n71. In 1947 the United Kingdom announced its intention to complete evacuation of the mandated territory by 1 August 1948, subsequently advancing that date to 15 May 1948. In the meantime, the General Assembly had on 29 November 1947 adopted resolution 181 (Il) on the future government of Palestine, which \"Recommends to the United Kingdom ... and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation ... of the Plan of Partition\" of the territory, as set forth in the resolution, between two independent States, one Arab, the other Jewish, as well as the creation of a special international régime for the City of Jerusalem. The Arab population of Palestine and the Arab States rejected this plan, contending that it was unbalanced; on 14 May 1948, Israel proclaimed its independence on the strength of the General Assembly resolution; armed conflict then broke out between Israel and a number of Arab States and the Plan of Partition was not implemented.\n\n72. By resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, the Security Council decided that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\" and called upon the parties directly involved in the conflict to seek agreement to this end. In conformity with this decision, general armistice agreements were concluded in 1949 between Israel and the neighbouring States through mediation by the United Nations. In particular, one such agreement was signed in Rhodes on 3 April 1949 between Israel and Jordan. Articles V and VI of that Agreement fixed the armistice demarcation line between Israeli and Arab forces (often later called the \"Green Line\" owing to the colour used for it on maps; hereinafter the \"Green Line\"). Article III, paragraph 2, provided that \"No element of the ... military or para-military forces of either Party ... shall advance beyond or pass over for any purpose whatsoever the Armistice Demarcation Lines ...\" It was agreed in Article VI paragraph 8, that these provisions would not be \"interpreted as prejudicing, in any sense, an ultimate political settlement between the Parties\". It was also stated that \"the Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of [the] Agreement [were] agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto\". The Demarcation Line was subject to such rectification as might be agreed upon by the parties.\n\n73. In the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories which had constituted Palestine under British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank, lying to the east of the Green Line).\n\n74. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), which emphasized the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and called for the \"Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\", and \"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\".\n\n75. From 1967 onwards, Israel took a number of measures in these territories aimed at changing the status of the City of Jerusalem. The Security Council, after recalling on a number of occasions \"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\", condemned those measures and, by resolution 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971, confirmed in the clearest possible terms that:\n\n\"all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status\".\n\nLater, following the adoption by Israel on 30 July 1980 of the Basic Law making Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel, the Security Council, by resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, stated that the enactment of that Law constituted a violation of international law and that \"all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem ... are null and void\". It further decided \"not to recognize the 'basic law' and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem\".\n\n76. Subsequently, a peace treaty was signed on 26 October 1994 between Israel and Jordan. That treaty fixed the boundary between the two States \"with reference to the boundary definition under the Mandate as is shown in Annex 1 (a) ... without prejudice to the status of any territories that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\" (Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2). Annex 1 provided the corresponding maps and added that, with regard to the \"territory that came under Israeli military government control in 1967\", the line indicated \"is the administrative boundary\" with Jordan.\n\n77. Lastly, a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization imposing various obligations on each party. Those agreements inter alia required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. Such transfers have taken place, but, as a result of subsequent events, they remained partial and limited.\n\n78. The Court would observe that, under customary international law as reflected (see paragraph 89 below) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter \"the Hague Regulations of 1907\"), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (see paragraph 72 above) and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.\n\n79. It is essentially in these territories that Israel has constructed or plans to construct the works described in the report of the Secretary-General. The Court will now describe those works, basing itself on that report. For developments subsequent to the publication of that report, the Court will refer to complementary information contained in the Written Statement of the United Nations, which was intended by the Secretary-General to supplement his report (hereinafter \"Written Statement of the Secretary-General\").\n\n80. The report of the Secretary-General states that \"The Government of Israel has since 1996 considered plans to halt infiltration into Israel from the central and northern West Bank...\" (para. 4). According to that report, a plan of this type was approved for the first time by the Israeli Cabinet in July 2001. Then, on 14 April 2002, the Cabinet adopted a decision for the construction of works, forming what Israel describes as a \"security fence\", 80 kilometres in length, in three areas of the West Bank.\n\nThe project was taken a stage further when, on 23 June 2002, the Israeli Cabinet approved the first phase of the construction of a \"continuous fence\" in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). On 14 August 2002, it adopted the line of that \"fence\" for the work in Phase A, with a view to the construction of a complex 123 kilometres long in the northern West Bank, running from the Salem checkpoint (north of Jenin) to the settlement at Elkana. Phase B of the work was approved in December 2002, It entailed a stretch of some 40 kilometres running east from the Salem checkpoint towards Beth Shean along the northern part of the Green Line as far as the Jordan Valley. Furthermore, on 1 October 2003, the Israeli Cabinet approved a full route, which, according to the report of the Secretary-General, \"will form one continuous line stretching 720 kilometres along the West Bank\". A map showing completed and planned sections was posted on the Israeli Ministry of Defence website on 23 October 2003. According to the particulars provided on that map, a continuous section (Phase C) encompassing a number of large settlements will link the north-western end of the \"security fence\" built around Jerusalem with the southern point of Phase A construction at Elkana. According to the same map, the \"security fence\" will run for 115 kilometres from the Har Gilo settlement near Jerusalem to the Carmel settlement south-east of Hebron (Phase D). According to Ministry of Defence documents, work in this sector is due for completion in 2005. Lastly, there are references in the case file to Israel's planned construction of a \"security fence\" following the Jordan Valley along the mountain range to the west.\n\n81. According to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the first part of these works (Phase A), which ultimately extends for a distance of 150 kilometres, was declared completed on 31 July 2003. It is reported that approximately 56,000 Palestinians would be encompassed in enclaves. During this phase, two sections totalling 19.5 kilometres were built around Jerusalem. In November 2003 construction of a new section was begun along the Green Line to the west of the Nazlat IssaBaqa al-Sharqiya enclave, which in January 2004 was close to completion at the time when the Secretary-General submitted his Written Statement.\n\nAccording to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works carried out under Phase B were still in progress in January 2004. Thus an initial section of this stretch, which runs near or on the Green Line to the village of al-Mutilla, was almost complete in January 2004. Two additional sections diverge at this point. Construction started in early January 2004 on one section that runs due east as far as the Jordanian border. Construction of the second section, which is planned to run from the Green Line to the village of Taysir, has barely begun. The United Nations has, however, been informed that this second section might not be built.\n\nThe Written Statement of the Secretary-General further states that Phase C of the work, which runs from the terminus of Phase A, near the Elkana settlement, to the village of Nu'man, south-east of Jerusalem, began in December 2003. This section is divided into three stages. In Stage C1, between inter alia the villages of Rantis and Budrus, approximately 4 kilometres out of a planned total of 40 kilometres have been constructed. Stage C2, which will surround the so-called \"Ariel Salient\" by cutting 22 kilometres into the West Bank, will incorporate 52,000 Israeli settlers. Stage C3 is to involve the construction of two \"depth barriers\"; one of these is to run north-south, roughly parallel with the section of Stage C1 currently under construction between Rantis and Budrus, whilst the other runs east-west along a ridge said to be part of the route of Highway 45, a motorway under construction. If construction of the two barriers were completed, two enclaves would be formed, encompassing 72,000 Palestinians in 24 communities.\n\nFurther construction also started in late November 2003 along the south-eastern part of the municipal boundary of Jerusalem, following a route that, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, cuts off the suburban village of El-Ezariya from Jerusalem and splits the neighbouring Abu Dis in two.\nAs at 25 January 2004, according to the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, some 190 kilometres of construction had been completed, covering Phase A and the greater part of Phase B. Further construction in Phase C had begun in certain areas of the central West Bank and in Jerusalem. Phase D, planned for the southern part of the West Bank, had not yet begun.\n\nThe Israeli Government has explained that the routes and timetable as described above are subject to modification. In February 2004, for example, an 8-kilometre section near the town of Baqa al-Sharqiya was demolished, and the planned length of the wall appears to have been slightly reduced.\n\n82. According to the description in the report and the Written Statement of the Secretary-General, the works planned or completed have resulted or will result in a complex consisting essentially of:\n(l) a fence with electronic sensors;\n(2) a ditch (up to 4 metres deep);\n(3) a two-lane asphalt patrol road;\n(4) a trace road (a strip of sand smoothed to detect footprints) running parallel to the fence;\n(5) a stack of six coils of barbed wire marking the perimeter of the complex.\n\nThe complex has a width of 50 to 70 metres, increasing to as much as 100 metres in some places. \"Depth barriers\" may be added to these works.\n\nThe approximately 180 kilometres of the complex completed or under construction as of the time when the Secretary-General submitted his report included some 8.5 kilometres of concrete wall. These are generally found where Palestinian population centres are close to or abut Israel (such as near Qalqiliya and Tulkarm or in parts of Jerusalem).\n\n83. According to the report of the Secretary-General, in its northernmost part, the wall as completed or under construction barely deviates from the Green Line. It nevertheless lies within occupied territories for most of its course. The works deviate more than 7.5 kilometres from the Green Line in certain places to encompass settlements, while encircling Palestinian population areas. A stretch of 1 to 2 kilometres west of Tulkarm appears to run on the Israeli side of the Green Line. Elsewhere, on the other hand, the planned route would deviate eastward by up to 22 kilometres. In the case of Jerusalem, the existing works and the planned route lie well beyond the Green Line and even in some cases beyond the eastern municipal boundary of Jerusalem as fixed by Israel.\n\n84. On the basis of that route, approximately 975 square kilometres (or 16.6 per cent of the West Bank) would, according to the report of the Secretary-General, lie between the Green Line and the wall. This area is stated to be home to 237,000 Palestinians. If the full wall were completed as planned, another 160,000 Palestinians would live in almost completely encircled communities, described as enclaves in the report. As a result of the planned route, nearly 320,000 Israeli settlers (of whom 178,000 in East Jerusalem) would be living in the area between the Green Line and the wall.\n\n85. Lastly, it should be noted that the construction of the wall has been accompanied by the creation of a new administrative régime. Thus in October 2003 the Israeli Defence Forces issued Orders establishing the part of the West Bank lying between the Green Line and the wall as a Closed Area. Residents of this area may no longer remain in it, nor may non-residents enter it, unless holding a permit or identity card issued by the Israeli authorities. According to the report of the Secretary-General, most residents have received permits for a limited period. Israeli citizens, Israeli permanent residents and those eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return may remain in, or move freely to, from and within the Closed Area without a permit. Access to and exit from the Closed Area can only be made through access gates, which are opened infrequently and for short periods.
    \n\n86. The Court will now determine the rules and principles of international law which are relevant in assessing the legality of the measures taken by Israel. Such rules and principles can be found in the United Nations Charter and certain other treaties, in customary international law and in the relevant resolutions adopted pursuant to the Charter by the General Assembly and the Security Council. However, doubts have been expressed by Israel as to the applicability in the Occupied Palestinian Territory of certain rules of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments. The Court will now consider these various questions.\n\n87. The Court first recalls that, pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.On 24 October 1970, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV),  entitled Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (hereinafter resolution 2625 (XXV)), in which it emphasized that  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. As the Court  stated in its Judgment in the case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the Charter reflect customary international law (see I.C.J. Reports 1986, pp. 98-101, paras. 187-190); the same is true of its corollary entailing the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force.
    \n\n88. The Court also notes that the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) cited above, pursuantto which Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to [in that resolution] ... of their right to self-determination. Article I common to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and lays upon the States parties the obligation to promote the realization of that right and to respect it, in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court would recall that in 1971 it emphasized that current developments in international law in regard to non-self-governing territories, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, made the principle of self-determination applicable to all [such territories]. The Court went on to state that These developments leave little doubt that the ultimate objective of the sacred trust referred to in Article 22, paragraph 1 , of the Covenant of the League of Nations was the self-determination ... of the  peoples concerned (Legal Consequences for Stales of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 31, paras. 52-53). The Court has referred to this principle on a number of occasions in its jurisprudence (ibid. ; see also Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, p. 68, para. 162). The Court indeed made it clear that the right of peoples to self-determination is today a right erga omnes (see East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29).  
    \n\n89. As regards international humanitarian law, the Court would first note that Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which the Hague Regulations are annexed. The Court observes that, in the words of the Convention, those Regulations were prepared to revise the general laws and customs of war existing at that time. Since then, however, the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg has found that the rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war (Judgment of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, 30 September and 1 October 1946, p. 65). The Court itself reached the same conclusion when examining the rights and duties of belligerents in their conduct of military operations (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (I) , p . 256, para. 75). The Court considers that the provisions of the Hague Regulations have become part or customary law, as is in fact recognized by all the participants in the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe Court also observes that, pursuant to Article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is supplementary to Sections II and III of the Hague Regulations. Section III of those Regulations, which concerns Military authority over the territory or the hostile State, is particularly pertinent in the present case.
    \n\n90. Secondly, with regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention, differing views have been expressed by the participants in these proceedings. Israel, contrary to the great majority of the other participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In particular, in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 to the report of the Secretary-General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Government of Israel, it is stated that Israel does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian Territory, citing the lack of recognition of the territory as sovereign prior to its annexation by Jordan and Egypt and inferring that it is not a territory of a High Contracting Party as required by the Convention
    \n\n91. The Court would recall that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention. Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951. Neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings.  Furthermore, Palestine gave a unilateral undertaking, by declaration of 7 June 1982, to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention. Switzerland, as depositary State, considered that unilateral undertaking valid. It concluded, however, that it ¨[was] not - as a depositary - in a position to decide whether¨ ¨the request [dated 14 June 1989] from the Palestine Liberation Movement in the name of the 'State of Palestine' to accede inter alia to the Fourth Cieneva Convention can be considered as an instrument of accession
    \n\n92. Moreover, for the purpose of determining the scope of application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, it should be recalled that under common Article 2 of the four Conventions of 12 August 1949:  \n\nIn addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.  \n\nThe Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.  Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  
    \n\n93. After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Israeli authorities issued an order No. 3 stating in its Article 35 that: \n\nThe Military Court ... must apply the provisions of the Geneva  Convention dated 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of  Civilian Persons in Time of War with respect to judicial procedures. In case of conflict between this Order and the said Convention, the Convention shall prevail.¨\n\nSubsequently, the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel's position as briefly recalled in paragraph 90 above, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that Jordan was admittedly a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1967, and that an armed conflict broke out at that time between Israel and Jordan, but it goes on to observe that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to that conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. It infers from this that that Convention is not applicable de jure in those territories. According however to the great majority of other participants in the proceedings, the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable  to those territories pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1 , whether or not Jordan had any rights in respect thereof prior to 1967.
    \n\n94. The Court would recall that, according to customary international law as expressed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Article 32 provides that: \n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 ... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure: or ... leads to a result which is manifestly obscure or unreasonable. (See Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection,  Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), p. 812, para. 23; see, similarly, Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (II), p. 1059, para. 18, and Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 645, para. 37.)
    \n\n95. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that Convention is applicable when two conditions are fulfilled: that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized); and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties. If those two conditions are satisfied, the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties.  The object of the second paragraph of Article 2 is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties. It is directed simply to making it clear that, even if occupation during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.\n\nThis interpretation reflects the intention of the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians who find themselves, in whatever way, in the hands of the occupying Power. Whilst the drafters of the Hague Regulations of 1907 were as much concerned with protecting the rights of a State whose territory is occupied, as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians in time of war, regardless of the  status of the occupied territories, as is shown by Article 47 of the Convention.  That interpretation is confirmed by the Convention's travaux préparatoires.  The Conference of Government Experts convened by the International  Committee the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC) in the aftermath of the Second  World War for the purpose of preparing the new Geneva Conventions  recommended that these conventions be applicable to any armed conflict  whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties and in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war (Report on the Work of the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 14-26 April 1947, p. 8). The drafters of the second paragraph of Article 2 thus had no intention, when they inserted that paragraph into the Convention, of restricting the latter's scope of application. They were merely seeking to provide for cases of occupation without combat, such as the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Germany in 1939. 
    \n\n96. The Court would moreover note that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention approved that interpretation at their Conference on 15 July 1999. They issued a statement in which they reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Subsequently, on 5 December the High Contracting Parties, referring in particular to Article 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, once again reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They further reminded the Contracting Parties participating in the Conference, the parties to the conflict, and the State of Israel as occupying Power, of their respective obligations.  
    \n\n97. Moreover, the Court would observe that the ICRC, whose special position with respect to execution of the Fourth Geneva Convention must be recognized and respected at all times by the parties pursuant  to Article 142 of the Convention, has also expressed its opinion on the interpretation to be given to the Convention. In a declaration of 5 December 2001, it recalled that the ICRC has always affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem.  
    \n\n98. The Court notes that the General Assembly has, in many of its resolutions, taken a position to the same effect. Thus on 10 December 2001 and 9 December 2003, in resolutions 56/60 and 58/97, it reaffirmed\n\nthat the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
    \n\n99. The Security Council, for its part, had already on 14 June 1967 taken the view in resolution 237 (1967) that all the obligations of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  should be complied with by the parties involved in the conflict. Subsequently, on 15 September 1969, the Security Council, in resolution 271 (1969), called upon Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation.\n\nTen years later, the Security Council examined the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories  occupied since 1967. In resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, the Security Council considered that those settlements had no legal validity and affirmed once more that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including  Jerusalem. It called once more upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by that Convention.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, the Security Council, in resolution 681 (1990), urged the Government of Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the  Fourth Geneva Convention... to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention. It further  called upon the high contracting parties to the said Fourth Geneva  Convention to ensure respect by Israel, the occupying Power, for its  obligations under the Convention in accordance with article 1 thereof.\n\nLastly, in resolutions 799 (1992) of 18 December 1992 and 904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, the Security Council reaffirmed its position concerning the  applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied territories.
    \n\n100. The Court would note finally that the Supreme Court of Israel, in a judgment dated 30 May 2004, also found that:\n\nThe military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ...  and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949.
    \n\n101. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties. Israel and Jordan were parties to that Convention when the 1967 armed conflict broke out. The Court accordingly finds that that Convention is applicable in the Palestinian territories which before the conflict lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied by Israel, there being no need for any enquiry into the precise prior status of those territories.  
    \n\n102. The participants in the proceedings before the Court also disagree whether the international human rights conventions to which Israel is party apply within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states :  4. Israel denies that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which it has signed, are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory. It asserts that humanitarian law is the protection granted in a conflict situation such as the one in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own Government in times of peace.  Of the other participants in the proceedings, those who addressed this issue contend that, on the contrary, both Covenants are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n103. On 3 October 1991 Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 December 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the same date, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 2() November 1989. It is a party to these three instruments.  
    \n\n104. In order to determine whether these texts are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court will first address the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law and then that of the applicability of human rights instruments outside national territory.
    \n\n105. In its Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the Court had occasion to address the first or these issues in relation to the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. In those proceedings certain States had argued that the Covenant was directed to the protection of human rights in peacetime, but that questions relating to unlawful loss of life in hostilities were governed by the law applicable in armed conflict (I. C.I Reports 1996 p. 239, 24).  The Court rejected this argument, stating that:  the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. Respect for the r ight to life is not, however, such a provision. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. (Ibid., p. 240, para. 25.)  
    \n\n106. More generally, the Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, as lex specialis, international humanitarian law.  
    \n\n107. It remains to be determined whether the two international Covenants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are applicable only on the territories 01 the States parties thereto or whether they are also applicable outside those territories and, if so , in what circumstances. The scope of application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is defined by Article 2, paragraph l , thereof, which provides :  
    \n\nEach State I Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex , language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nThis provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within a State's territory and subject to that State's jurisdiction. It can also be construed as covering both individuals present within 'a State's territory and those out side that territory but subject to that State's jurisdiction. The Court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text.  
    \n\n109. The Court would observe that, while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised outside the national  territory. Considering the object and purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it would seem natural that, even when such is the case, States parties to the Covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe constant practice of the Human Rights Committee is consistent with this. Thus, the Committee has found the Covenant applicable where the State exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory. It has ruled on the legality of acts by Uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by Uruguayan agents in Brazil or Argentina (case No. 52/79, Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay ; case No. 56/79, Lilian Celiberti de Casariego v. Uruguay). It decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of a passport by a Uruguayan consulate in Germany (case No. 106/81, Montero v. Uruguay).  \n\nThe travaux préparatories of the Covenant confirm the Committee's interpretation of Article 2 of that instrument. These show that, in adopting the  wording chosen, the drafters of the Covenant did not intend to allow States to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory. They only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting, vis -å-vis their State of origin, rights that do not fall within the competence of that State, but of that of the State o f residence (see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN .4/SR.194, para. 46 ; and United Nations, Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Session, Annexes, A/2929, Part Il, Chap. V , para. 4 (1955)).  
    \n\n110. The Court takes note in this connection of the position taken by Israel, in relation to the applicability of the Covenant, in its communications to the Human Rights Committee, and of the view of the Committee.   In 1998, Israel stated that, when preparing its report to the Committee, it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to Israel's jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the Covenant  (CCPR/C/SR.1675, para. 21). Israel took the position that the Covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories (ibid. para. 27).  The Committee, in its concluding observations after examination of the report, expressed concern at Israel's attitude and pointed to the long -standing presence of Israel in a [the occupied] territories, Israel's   ambiguous attitude towards their future status, as well as the exercise of  effective jurisdiction by Israeli security forces therein (CCPR/C/79/ Add.93,  para. 10). In 2003 in face of Israel's consistent position, to the effect that the Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and Gaza the Committee reached the following conclusion :   in the current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by the State party's authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law (CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. II).
    \n\n111. In conclusion, the Court considers that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.  
    \n\n112. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains no provision on its scope of application. This may be explicable by the fact that this Covenant guarantees rights which are essentially territorial. However, it is not to be excluded that it applies both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction. Thus Article 14 makes provision for transitional measures in the case of any State which at the time of becoming a Party, has not been able to secure in its metropolitan territory or other territories under its jurisdiction compulsory primary education, free of charge.  \n\nIt is not without relevance to recall in this regard the position taken by Israel in its reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its initial report to the Committee of 4 December 1998, Israel provided statistics indicating the  enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by Israeli settlers in the occupied Territories. The Committee noted that, according to Israel, the Palestinian population within the same jurisdictional areas were excluded from both the report and the protection of the Covenant (E/C.12/l/Add.27, para. 8). The Committee expressed its concern in this regard, to which Israel replied in a further report of 19 October 2001 that it has consistently maintained that the Covenant does not apply to areas that a re not subject to its sovereign territory and jurisdiction (a formula inspired by the language of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This position, continued Israel, is based on the well -established distinction between human rights and humanitarian law under international law. It added: the Committee's mandate  cannot relate to events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, inasmuch as they are part and parcel of the context of armed conflict as distinct from a relationship of human rights (E/ 1990/6/ Add. 32, para. 5). In view of these observations, the Committee  reiterated  its concern about Israel's position and reaffirmed its view that the State party's obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective control (E/C. 12/1/Add.90, paras. 15 and 31).  For the reasons explained in paragraph 106 above, the Court cannot accept Israel's view. It would also observe that the territories occupied by Israel have for over 37 years been subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.  
    \n\n113. As regards the Convention on the Rights or the Child of 20 November 1989, that instrument contains an Article 2 according to which States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the ... Convention to each child within their jurisdiction. That Convention is therefore applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n114. Having determined the rules and principles of international law relevant to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, and having ruled in particular on the applicability within the Occupied Palestinian Territory of international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Court will now seek to ascertain whether the construction of the wall has violated those rules and principles.  
    \n\n115. In this regard, Annex Il to the report of the Secretary -General, entitled Summary Legal Position of the Palestine Liberation Organization' states that The construction of the Barrier is an attempt to annex the territory contrary to international law  and that The de facto annexation of land with the territorial sovereignty and consequently with the right of the Palestinians to self -determination. This view was echoed in certain of the written statements submitted to the Court and in the views expressed at the hearings. Inter alia, it was contended that:  The wall severs the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination and constitutes a violation of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by the use of force.'\n\nIn this connection, it was in particular emphasized that at]he route of the wall is designed to change the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by reinforcing the Israeli  settlements illegally established on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was further contended that the wall aimed at reducing and parcelling out the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self -determination' .  
    \n\n116. For its part, Israel has argued that the wall's sole purpose is to enable it effectively to combat terrorist attacks launched from the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel has repeatedly stated that the Barrier is a temporary measure (see report of the Secretary -General, para. 29). It did so inter alia through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations at the Security Council meeting of 14 October 2003, emphasizing that the route does not annex territories to the State of Israel, and that Israel  is 'ready and able, at tremendous cost, to adjust or dismantle a fence if so required as part of a political settlement (S/PV .4841, p. 10). Israel's Permanent Representative restated this view before the General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December 2003. On  this latter occasion, he added :  As soon as the terror ends, the fence will no longer be necessary. The fence is not a border and has no political significance. It does not change the legal status of the territory in any way. (A/ES -IO/  
    \n\n117. The Court would recall that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have referred, with regard to Palestine, to the customary rule of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war (see paragraphs 74 and 87 above). Thus in  resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, the Security Council, after recalling this rule, affirmed that: the fulfilment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles: \n\n(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;  \n\n(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force'  It is on this same basis that the Council has several times condemned the measures taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem (see paragraph 75 above).  
    \n\n118. As regards the principle of the right of peoples to self -determination, the Court observes that the existence of a Palestinian people is no   longer in issue. Such existence has moreover been recognized by Israel in the exchange of letters of 9 September 1993 between Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister. In that  correspondence, the President of the PLO recognized the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security and made various other commitments. In reply, the Israeli Prime Minister informed him that, in the light of those commitments, the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative or the Palestinian people. The Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also refers a number of times to the Palestinian people an d its legitimate rights (Preamble, paras. 4, 7, 8; Article Il, para. 2; Article Ill, paras. I and 3; Article XXII, para. 2). The Court considers that those rights include the right to self -determination, as the General Assembly has moreover recognized on a number of occasions (see, for example, resolution 58/163 of 22 December 20()3).
    \n\n119. The Court notes that the route of the wall as fixed by the Israeli Government includes within the Closed Area (see paragraph 85 above) some 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, it is apparent from an examination of the map mentioned in paragraph 80 above that the wall's sinuous route has been traced in such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem).  
    \n\n120. As regards these settlements, the Court notes that Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. That provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the  occupied territory.  In this respect, the information provided to the Court shows that, since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, contrary to the terms of Article 49, para graph 6, just cited.  \n\nThe Security Council has thus taken the view that such policy and practices have no legal validity. It has also called upon Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the Fourth Geneva Convention and:  
    \n\nto rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem   and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories (resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979)).  The Council reaffirmed its position in resolutions 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979 and 465 (1980) of I March 1980. Indeed, in the latter case it described Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in [the occupied] territories as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  \n\nThe Court concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law. 
    \n\n121. Whilst the Court notes the assurance given by Israel that the construction of the wall does not amount to annexation and that the wall is of a temporary nature (see paragraph 1 16 above), it nevertheless cannot remain indifferent to certain fears expressed  to it that the route of the wall will  prejudge the future frontier between Israel and Palestine, and the fear that Israel may integrate the settlements and their means of access. The Court considers that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation.  
    \n\n122. The Court recalls moreover that, according to the report of the Secretary -General, the planned route would incorporate in the area between the Green Line and the wall more than 16 per cent of the territory of the West Bank. Around 80 per cent of the settlers living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that is 320,000 individuals, would reside in that area, as well as 237,000 Palestinians. Moreover, as a result of the construction of the wall, around 160,000 other Palestinians would reside in almost completely encircled communities (see paragraphs 84, 85 and 1 19 above).  In other terms, the route chosen for the wall gives expression in loco to the illegal measures taken by Israel with regard to Jerusalem and the settlements„ as deplored by the Security Council (see paragraphs 75 and 12() above). There is also a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian Territory resulting from the construction of the wall inasmuch as it is contributing, as will be further explained in  133 below, to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. That construction, along with measures taken previously, thus severely impedes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self -determination, and is therefore a breach of Israel's obligation to respect that right.  
    \n\n123. The construction of the wall also raises a number of issues in relation to the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and of human rights instruments.  
    \n\n124. With regard to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the Court would recall that these deal, in Section II, with hostilities and in particular with means of injuring the enemy, sieges, and bombardments. Section III deals with military authority in occupied territories. Only Section III is currently applicable in the West Bank and Article 23 (g) of the Regulations, in Section II, is thus not pertinent. Section III of the Hague Regulations includes Articles 43, 46 and 52, which are applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 43 imposes a duty on the occupant to take all measures within his power to restore, and, as far as possible, to insure public order and life, respecting the laws in force in the country. Article 46 adds that private property must be respected and that it cannot be confiscated. Lastly, Article 52 authorizes, within certain limits, requisitions in kind and services fo r the needs of the army of occupation.  
    \n\n125. A distinction is also made in the Fourth Geneva Convention between provisions applying during military operations leading to occupation and those that remain applicable throughout the entire period of occupation. It thus states in Article 6:  \n\nThe present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.  In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.  In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power  exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: I to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.  Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re -establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.'  Since the military operations leading to the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 ended a long time ago, only those Articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention referred to in Article 6, paragraph 3, remain applicable in that occupied territory.  
    \n\n126. These provisions include Articles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the  Fourth Geneva Convention. According to Article 47 :\n\nProtected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be  deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded  between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.   Article 49 reads as follows: \n\nIndividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. \n\nNevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bound s of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'  According to Article 52:  'No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention.  Alt measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the occupying Power, arc prohibited.' \n\nArticle 53 provides that:  \n\nAny destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or co -operative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  Lastly, according to Article 59:  If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.  Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection.  A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.'   
    \n\n127. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also contains several relevant provisions. Before further examining these, the Court will observe that Article 4 of the Covenant allows for derogation to be made, under various conditions, to certain provisions of that instrument. Israel made use of' its right of derogation under this Article by addressing the following communication to the Secretary -General of the United Nations on 3 October 1991 \n\n'Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks, and campaigns of terrorism resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings.\n\nIn view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in force ever since. This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 ( l) of the Covenant.  The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of  the State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and detention.  In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby derogates from its obligations under that provision.\n\nThe Court notes that the derogation so notified concerns only Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with the right to liberty and security of person and lays down the rules applicable in cases of arrest or detention. The other Articles of the Covenant therefore remain applicable not only on Israeli territory, but also on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
    \n\n128. Among these mention must be made of Article 17, paragraph I of which reads as follows: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.  Mention must also be made of Article 12, paragraph l , which provides: Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.  
    \n\n129. In addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account must also be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. The status of the Christian Holy Places in the Ottoman Empire dates far back in time, the latest provisions relating thereto having been incorporated into Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Mandate for Palestine given to the British Government on 24 July 1922 included an Article 13, under which : \n\nAll responsibility in connection with the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving existing rights and of securing free access to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites and the free exercise of worship, while ensuring the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory. Article 13 further stated: nothing in this mandate shall be construed as conferring ... authority to interfere with the fabric or the management of purely Moslem sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed'  In the aftermath of the Second World War, the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine, devoted an entire chapter of the Plan of Partition to the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites. Article 2 of this Chapter provided, in so far as the Holy Places were concerned : \n\nthe liberty of access, visit and transit shall be guaranteed, in conformity  with existing rights, to all residents and citizens [of the Arab  State, of the Jewish State] and of the City of Jerusalem, as well as to aliens, without distinction as to nationality, subject to requirements of national security, public order and decorum.  Subsequently, in the aftermath of the armed conflict of 1948, the 1949 General  Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel provided in Article V Ill for the establishment of a special committee for the formulation of agreed plans and arrangements for su ch matters as either Party may submit to it for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Agreement and of effecting improvement in its application. Such matters, on which an agreement of principle had already been concluded, included free access to the Holy Places.  \n\nThis commitment concerned mainly the Holy Places located to the east of the Green Line. However, some Holy Places were located west of that Line. This was the case of the Room of the Last Supper and the Tomb of David, on Mount Zion. In signing the General Armistice Agreement, Israel thus undertook, as did Jordan, to guarantee freedom of access to the Holy Places. The Court considers that this undertaking by Israel has remained valid for the Holy Places which came under its control in 1967. This undertaking has further been confirmed by Article 9, paragraph I  of the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, by virtue of which, in more general terms, Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance.  
    \n\n130. As regards the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that instrument includes a number of relevant provisions, namely: the right to work (Arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right to be free from hunger (Art. II ) ; the right to health (Art. 12); the right to education (Arts. 13 and 14).  
    \n\n131. Lastly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 includes similar provisions in Articles 16, 24, 27 and 28.  
    \n\n132. From the information submitted to the Court, particularly the report of the Secretary -General, it appears that the construction of the wall has led to the destruction or requisition of properties under conditions which contravene the requirements of Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 and of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
    \n\n133. That construction, the establishment of a closed area between the Green Line and the wall itself and the creation of enclaves have moreover imposed substantial restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory  (with the exception of  Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto). Such restrictions are most marked in urban areas, such as the Qalqiliya enclave or the City of Jerusalem and its suburbs. They are aggravated by the fact that the access gates are few in number in certain sectors and opening hours appear to be restricted and unpredictably applied. For example, according to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, Qalqiliya, a city with a population of 40,000, is completely surrounded by the Wall and residents can only enter and leave through a single military checkpoint open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, submitted in accordance with Commission resolution 1993/2 A and entitled Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine, E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.)  \n\nThere have also been serious repercussions for agricultural production, as is attested by a number of sources. According to the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories  an estimated 100,000 dunums [approximately 10,000 hectares] of the West Banks most fertile agricultural land, confiscated by the Israeli Occupation Forces, have been destroyed during the first phase of the wall construction, which involves the disappearance of vast amounts of property, notably private agricultural land and olive trees, wells, citrus grows and hothouses upon which tens of thousands of Palestinians rely for their survival (Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, A/58/31 1, 22 August 2003, para. 26).  Further, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Much of the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the Wall consists of fertile agricultural land and some of the most important water wells in the region and adds that Many fruit and olive trees had been destroyed in the course of building the barrier (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights states that construction of the wall cuts off Palestinians from their agricultural lands, wells and means of subsistence (Report by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Jean Ziegler, The Right to Food, Addendum, Mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, E/CN .41 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 49). In a recent survey conducted by the World Food Programme, it is stated that the situation has aggravated food insecurity in the region, which reportedly numbers 25,000 new beneficiaries of food aid (report of the Secretary -General, para. 25).  It has further led to increasing difficulties for the population concerned regarding access to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water. This is also attested by a number of different information  sources. Thus the report of the Secretary -General states generally that According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, so far the Barrier has separated 30 localities from health services, 22 from schools, 8 from primary water sources and 3 from electricity networks. (Report of the Secretary -General, para. 23.) The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 states that Palestinians between the Wall and Green Line will effectively be cut off from their land and workplaces, schools, health clinics and other social services. (E/CN.4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 9.) In relation specifically to water resources, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights observes that By constructing the fence Israel will also effectively annex most of the western aquifer system (which provides 51 per cent of the West Bank's water resources). (E/CN.4/2004/l O/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) Similarly. in regard to access to health services, it has been stated that, as a result of the enclosure of Qalqiliya, a United Nations hospital in that town has recorded a 40 per cent decrease in its caseload (report of the Secretary -General, para. 24).\n\nAt Qalqiliya, according to reports furnished to the United Nations, some 600 shops or businesses have shut down, and 6,000 to 8,000 people have already left the region (E/CN .4/2004/6, 8 September 2003, para. 10; E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para . 51). The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has also observed that With the fence/wall cutting communities off from their land and water without other means of subsistence, many of the Palestinians living in these areas will be forced to leave. (E/CN.4/ 2004/10/Add.2, 31 October 2003, para. 51.) In this respect also the construction the wall would effectively deprive a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose [their] residence. I n addition, however, in the view of the Court, since a significant number of Palestinians have already been compelled by the construction of the wall and its associated régime to depart from certain areas, a process that will continue as more of the wall is built, that construction, coupled with the establishment of the Israeli settlements mentioned in paragraph 120 above, is tending to alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
    \n\n134. To sum up, the Court is of the opinion that the construction of the wall and its associated régime impede the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception  of Israeli citizens and those assimilated thereto) as guaranteed under Article 12, paragraph l , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also impede the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lastly, the construction of the wall and its associated régime, by  contributing to the demographic changes referred to in paragraphs 122 and 133 above, contravene Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Security Council resolutions cited in paragraph 120 above.
    \n\n135. The Court would observe, however, that the applicable international humanitarian law contains provisions enabling account to be taken of military exigencies in certain circumstances.  Neither Article 46 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 nor Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain any qualifying provision of this type. With regard to forcible transfers of population and deportations, which are prohibited under Article 49, paragraph I , of the Convention, paragraph 2 of that Article provides for an exception in those cases in which the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. This exception however does not apply to paragraph 6 of that Article, which  prohibits the occupying Power from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territories it occupies. As to Article 53 concerning the destruction of personal property, it provides for an exception where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  The Court considers that the military exigencies contemplated by these texts may be invoked in occupied territories even after the general close of the military operations that led to their occupation. However, on the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the destructions carried out contrary to the prohibition in Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention were rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  
    \n\n136. The Court would further observe that some human rights conventions, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain provisions which States parties may invoke in order to derogate, under various conditions, from certain of their conventional obligations. In this respect, the Court would however recall that the communication notified by Israel to the Secretary -General of the United Nations under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerns  only Article 9 of the Covenant, relating to the right to freedom and security of person (see paragraph 127 above); Israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument.\n\nThe Court would note, moreover, that certain provisions human rights conventions contain clauses qualifying the rights covered by those provisions. There is no clause of this kind in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the other hand, Article 12, paragraph 3, of that instrument provides that restrictions on liberty of movement as guaranteed under that Article  shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other right s recognized in the present Covenant.  As for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 thereof contains a general provision as follows:\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far a s this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.  The Court would observe that the restrictions provided for under Article 12, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are, by the very terms of that provision, exceptions to the right of freedom of movement contained in para graph l . In addition, it is not sufficient that such restrictions be directed to the ends authorized; they must also be necessary for the attainment of those ends. As the Human Rights Committee put it, they must conform to the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result (CCPR/C/21/Rev. l/Add.9, General Comment No. 27, para. 14). On the basis of the information available to it, the Court finds that these conditions are not met in the present instance.  The Court would further observe that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from Israel's construction of the wall, fail to meet a condition laid down by Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that is to say that their implementation must be solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society'  
    \n\n137. To sum up, the Court, from the material available to it, is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the wall was necessary to attain its security objectives. The wall, along the route chosen, and its associated régime gravely infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of various  of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments.
    \n\n138. The Court has thus concluded that the construction of the wall constitutes action not in conformity with various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel. However, Annex I to the report of the Secretary -General states that, according to Israel : the construction of the Barrier is consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, its inherent right to self -defence and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 More specifically, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations asserted in the General Assembly on 20 October 2003 that the fence is a measure wholly consistent with the right of States to self -defence enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter , the Security Council resolutions referred to, he continued, have clearly recognized the right of States to use force in self -defence against terrorist attacks, and therefore surely recognize the right to use non -forcible measures to that encl (A/ES -10/PV .21, p. 6).  
    \n\n139. Under the terms of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations:  Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international pea ce and security.  Article 51 of the Charter thus recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self -defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However, Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.\n\nThe Court also notes that Israel exercises control in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that, as Israel itself states, the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within, and not outside, that territory. The situation is thus different from that contemplated by Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and therefore Israel could not in any event invoke those resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self -defence.  Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 51 of the Charter has no relevance in this case.  
    \n\n140. The Court has, however, considered whether Israel could rely on a state of necessity which would preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall. In this regard the Court is bound to note that some of the conventions at issue in the present instance include qualifying clauses of the rights guaranteed or provisions for derogation (see para62  graphs 135 and 136 above). Since those treaties already address considerations of this kind within their own provisions, it might be asked whether a state of necessity as recognized in customary international law could be invoked with regard to those treaties as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the measures or decisions being challenged. However, the Court will not need to consider that question. As the Court observed in the case concerning the Gabéikovo -Nagymaros Project ( Hungary(Slovakia) , t he state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law that can only be accepted on an exceptional basis , it can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concern ed is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met (I. C. J. Reports 1997, p. 40, para. 51). One of those conditions was stated by the Court in terms used by the International Law Commission, in a text which in its present form requires that the act being challenged be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril (Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts; see also former Article 33 of the Draft Articles on the International Responsibility of States, with slightly different wording in the English text). In the light of the material before it, the Court is not convinced that the construction of the wall along the route chosen was the only means to safeguard the interests of Israel against the peril which it has invoked as justification for that construction.  
    \n\n141. The fact remains that Israel has to face numerous indiscriminate and deadly acts of violence against its civilian population. It has the right, and indeed the duty, to respond in order to protect the life of its citizens. The  measures taken are bound nonetheless to remain in conformity with applicable international law.  
    \n\n142. In conclusion, the Court considers that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall resulting from the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 122 and 137 abo ve. The Court accordingly finds that the  construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law.  
    \n\n143. The Court having concluded that, by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and by adopting its associated régime, Israel has violated various international obligations incumbent upon it ( see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above), it must now, in order to reply to the question posed by the General Assembly, examine the consequences of those violations.  
    \n\n144. In their written and oral observations, many participants in the proceedings before the Court contended that Israel's action in illegally constructing this wall has legal consequences not only for Israel itself, but also for other States and for the United  Nations; in its Written Statement, Israel, for its part, presented no arguments regarding the possible legal consequences of the construction of the wall.  
    \n\n145. As regards the legal consequences for Israel, it was contended that Israel has, first, a legal obligation to bring the illegal situation to an end by ceasing forthwith the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian  Territory, and to give appropriate assurances and guarantees of non -repetition.  It was argued that, secondly, Israel is under a legal obligation to make reparation for the damage arising from its unlawful conduct. It was submitted that such reparation should first of all take the form of restitution, namely demolition of those portion s of the wall constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and annulment of the legal acts associated with its construction and the restoration of property requisitioned or expropriated for that purpose; reparation should also include appropriate compensation for individuals whose homes or agricultural holdings have been destroyed.  It was further contended that Israel is under a continuing duty to comply with all of the international obligations violated by it as a result of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the associated régime. It was also argued that, under the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is under an obligation to search for and bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, grave breaches of international humanitarian law flowing from the planning, construction and use of the wall.  
    \n\n146. As regards the legal consequences for States other than Israel, it was contended before the Court that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co -operate with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring that reparation will be made therefor. \n\nCertain participants in the proceedings further contended that the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are obliged to take measures to ensure compliance with the Convention and that, inasmuch as the construction and maintenance of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitutes grave breaches of that Convention, the States parties to that Convention are under an obligation to prosecute or extradite the authors of such breaches. It was further observed that  the United Nations Security Council should consider flagrant and systematic violation of international law normas] and principles by Israel, particularly  international humanitarian law, and take all necessary measures to put an end ato] these violations,  and that the Security Council and the General Assembly must take due account of the advisory opinion to be given by the Court.  
    \n\n147. Since the Court has concluded that the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to various of Israel's international obligations, it follows that the responsibility of that State is engaged under international law.  
    \n\n148. The Court will now examine the legal consequences resulting from the violations of international law by Israel by distinguishing between, on the one hand, those arising for Israel and, on the other, those arising for other States and, where appropriate, fo r the United Nations. The Court will begin by examining the legal consequences of those violations for Israel.  
    \n\n149. The Court notes that Israel is first obliged to comply with the international obligations it has breached by the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see paragraphs 1 14 -137 above). Consequently, Israel is bound to comply with it s obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Furthermore, it must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places that came under its control following the 1967 War (see paragraph 129 above)."

    "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
    "texto": "With regard to the Quartet, it has expressed its concerns about the Wall. Moreover, despite the implication in one Statement to the Court that the members of the Quartet are in agreement that an advisory opinion would likely hinder the peace process, it should be clarified that there is no agreement among the Quartet with regard to asking the Court not to render the requested advisory opinion. The Statement of the Russian Federation does not ask the Court to refuse to give an opinion. The Statement of the United Nations does not do so. Nor does the European Union Statement. Irelands Minister for Foreign Affairs affirmed this in the Irish Senate on 4 February 2004, stating that “Contrary to some press reports, the EU has not asked the ICJ to refrain from issuing an Advisory Opinion. There would have been no consensus to adopt such a position.”4 Indeed, we even doubt whether the Statement of the United States could be characterized as such. Some States have said that an advisory opinion could harm the final status issues that should be left to the parties for negotiation. It is clearly Israeli actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and not any Court opinion, that will constitute illegal facts on the ground in relation to final status issues. Nevertheless, we do agree that the Court is not being asked to advise on solutions for the final status, although it will undoubtedly be necessary to make some reference to final status issues due to the intricate relationship between the Wall and the settlements and the character and route of the Wall in and around East Jerusalem. First, Israel objects that: “the request is ultra vires the competence of the 10th Emergency Special Session and/or the General Assembly... [as] there was no failure by the Security Council to act”. There is an initial and simple answer to this. The General Assemblys request for this opinion was made in a validly adopted resolution. In the Namibia case, you said: “A resolution of a properly constituted organ of the United Nations which is passed in accordance with that organs rules of procedure, and is declared by its President to have been so passed, must be presumed to have been validly adopted.”10 I stress that this is not a matter of fundamental competence but of internal procedure, to use the distinction you drew in the Use of Nuclear Weapons11 Advisory Opinion. But if it is necessary to go beyond this, the answer is still quite clear. Ambassador Al-Kidwa has outlined the circumstances surrounding the General Assemblys request. In the light of what he has said, nothing in the Uniting For Peace Resolution prevented the Assemblys adoption of this request. The request does not of course require the Court to take “action” within the meaning of Article 11, paragraph 2, of the Charter, nor did it involve such “action” by the General Assembly. No question involving the Charter distribution of authority between the General Assembly and the Security Council is raised. Again, I quote your words: “The Court considers that the kind of action referred to in Article 11, paragraph 2, is coercive or enforcement action... The word ‘action must mean such action as is solely within the province of the Security Council.”12 Requesting this advisory opinion is not solely within the province of the Security Council13. It is as simple as that. I turn to the other general objections. The starting point here is that the Court “should not, in principle, refuse to give an advisory opinion”, as you have many times said. As you recalled in Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons: “In accordance with the... jurisprudence of the Court, only ‘compelling reasons could lead it to such a refusal... There has been no refusal, based on the discretionary power of the Court, to act upon a request for an advisory opinion in the history of the present Court...” This position applies even more powerfully to the General Assembly, which the Charter expressly authorizes to request “an advisory opinion upon any legal question”15. And there can be no doubt that the question asked of the Court is a legal question, as you have consistently defined that term. Then it is said that the opinion is not useful. According to one statement: “there is a striking degree of consensus amongst those most closely involved in promoting the peace process in the Middle East that an advisory opinion would be of no assistance and would be likely to be unhelpful”. The first point to note is that this conclusory statement is untrue. Ambassador Al-Kidwa has shown that there was no consensus within the European Union or among the Quartet that the Court should decline to give an advisory opinion. Furthermore the Court gives an advisory opinion to the organ which requests it, not to a self-appointed group of States. You made this point in the Peace Treaties Opinion23, and you have repeated it frequently since24. And as you said in Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons: “it is not for the Court itself to purport to decide whether or not an advisory opinion is needed by the Assembly for the performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own needs.” The first of these issues is that of consent. Australia objects that: “The effect of the request is to bring key elements of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the Court for determination without the consent of Israel.” But South Africa did not consent to the Namibia request, Spain did not consent to the Western Sahara request, Romania did not consent to the Mazilu request, Malaysia did not consent to the Cumaraswamy request. All those requests involved the responsibility of a particular State. Yet you gave the Opinions. As you said in Western Sahara: “In the present case, Spain is a Member of the United Nations and has accepted the provisions of the Charter and Statute; it has thereby in general given its consent to the exercise by the Court of its advisory jurisdiction.”26 Moreover Israel cannot object, any more than could Spain, to the exercise by the General Assembly of its competence in the field of self-determination. It cannot object to the General Assembly dealing with the situation of Palestine. These competences of the General Assembly were exercised even before Israel came into existence, notably in the passage of the Partition Resolution, General Assembly resolution 181(II) which signalled the wish of the international community that Israel come into existence. The General Assembly has always had a vitally important role in relation to Palestine — as it had in relation to the other former mandated territory left over after 1945, South West Africa. This is a key aspect of the role it has consistently exercised with respect to dependent and colonized peoples ever since 1945. Israel and Palestine are not two States Members of the United Nations and the dispute over the Wall is not a pre-existing bilateral dispute on a matter falling in principle within Israels domestic jurisdiction. That was the situation in the Eastern Carelia case. It is not the situation here. There is no pre-existing bilateral dispute arising between Israel and Palestine, no dispute which (to use your words in Western Sahara) arose “independently in bilateral relations”27. There is no trace in the record of such a prior, independent bilateral dispute. Rather the Wall is an attempt by Israel to impose a unilateral settlement in relation to a multilateral conflict and to do so in violation of fundamental obligations, obligations erga omnes. These relate to humanitarian law and human rights, including self-determination. The people of Palestine have an unfulfilled right to self-determination. Israel cannot veto or negate the interest of the General Assembly in having a legal answer to the question asked. Indeed that interest, and the General Assemblys long-standing and legitimate institutional role, is a compelling reason for answering the question — as it was in Western Sahara, on a much more abstract question. This brings me to my final point, which is the impact of the request on the Road Map and on future status negotiations. The United States expresses the point in the following way: “The United States... and the other members of the Quartet are deeply involved in efforts to advance those negotiations, with the support and encouragement of the Security Council and the General Assembly. It would be extremely damaging to future negotiating efforts if the Court were to set forth, even on a non-binding advisory basis, legal conclusions with respect to permanent status issues.” Now formulated in these terms this is not an objection to your giving the request at all. It is a cautionary note as to the permanent status issues. In this moderate formulation (certain Written Statements were more extreme), it goes to the content of the Opinion, not to the question whether you should give it at all. And this recalls an answer you gave to an analogous objection in Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. You said: “It has also been submitted that a reply from the Court in this case might adversely affect disarmament negotiations... The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions... they... would present an additional element in the negotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter of appreciation... The Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.” In the present case the relationship between the Road Map and the Wall can be put in a couple of sentences. The Road Map is a project for the final settlement to be reached by agreement of interested parties, including Palestine. Substantively it has its origins in United Nations resolutions going back to Security Council resolution 242. The Wall is not in the Road Map. Indeed it is the Wall itself which is inconsistent with the Road Map, and the Wall, if allowed to be completed, will destroy the Road Map. The request, and the Courts opinion, can only support the multilateral process presently embodied in the Road Map. There is a further point, equally fundamental. The question you are asked relates to the present situation, not the future. You are not asked what the content of the final settlement should be. You are not asked to determine the boundaries of a future Palestinian State. It is sufficient for the purposes of this opinion that the Wall is being constructed for the most part, and indisputably, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. That is not a negative point, it is a positive point. In determining the present legality of the Wall in relation to the powers of Israel over the Occupied Palestinian Territory, you will be helping to elucidate and thereby to preserve the legal status quo pending the final status negotiations. You are asked to give an authoritative legal opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the Wall now. Your answer will be relevant to existing questions of legal status and its consequences. This will help to secure the foundations for a future agreement — unlike the Wall, which undermines those foundations."

      "texto": "Mr. President, Members of the Court, on behalf of Palestine, the Palestinian people and their leadership, I respectfully request the Court to give full consideration to the gravity of this situation and to the importance of an advisory opinion at this critical moment. In your most recent address before the General Assembly, Mr. President, you underlined the role of the Court as the “guardian of international law” and you assured the Assembly “that the Court will pursue its efforts to respond to the hopes placed in it”. The Palestinian people have great hopes for this proceeding and have full confidence that the Court will help the General Assembly to carry out its functions by rendering the advisory opinion. This would allow the Assembly to make its own substantial contribution in response to Israels continued construction of the Wall and the ensuing threats to the prospects for peace between the two peoples. It is our firm belief that such an advisory opinion can lead to positive developments and perhaps even a chain of events similar to that resulting from the Courts Advisory Opinion on Namibia.\n\nThen it is objected that the request “politicizes the Court” and that the Court should therefore refuse to give the opinion17. But as you said in Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons: “Whatever its political aspects, the Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question which invites it to discharge an essentially judicial task, namely, an assessment of the legality of the possible conduct of States with regard to the obligations imposed upon them by international law.”\n\nIndeed, as you noted in the WHO Regional Headquarters Advisory Opinion: “in situations in which political considerations are prominent it may be particularly necessary for an international organization to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court as to the legal principles applicable to the matter under debate...” particularly.\n\nThen it is objected that the General Assembly has already made up its mind and so you should remain silent. According to one statement: “An opinion by the Court would provide no guidance to the General Assembly, as that body has already pronounced itself on the issue.”20 But the General Assembly had already pronounced itself on the underlying issue in earlier cases — in Namibia, both the General Assembly and the Security Council had done so. Here, as in Namibia, you are asked to look at the legal consequences of a given situation in the light of certain resolutions; here, as there, you need to look at the legal position underlying those resolutions.\n\nEven more fundamentally what this objection ignores is that you do not give just another political opinion. You give a reasoned judicial opinion as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. In giving the opinion the Court remains “faithful to the requirements of its judicial character”21. The result is a judicial decision: it is not just a repetition of something the Assembly has already done. And if ever a situation needed a recent judicial opinion, it is this one.\n\nThen secondly, it is objected that the request is inadmissible because there is insufficient evidence before the Court to enable it to make the findings of fact required. According to Israel: “the Court has received no evidence from Israel bearing on the substantive question, and evidence received from others, including the United Nations Secretariat, cannot be regarded as authoritative or reliable”\n\nBut in all the Opinions you have given, you have used the information publicly available, where organizations could help you, you have asked them to help. You have used the information before you as best you could. It is true that in Eastern Carelia the Permanent Court gave as a subsidiary reason for not answering the question an issue of fact — the intention of Russia in making a declaration during the negotiation of a bilateral treaty29 that had nothing whatever to do with the League of Nations. The position is quite different here. This is not a matter within Israels domestic jurisdiction and not a matter on which it has a sovereign privilege to act.\n\nMuch more relevant is the approach of the Permanent Court in European Commission of the Danube. That was a dispute under a regional multilateral treaty between Romania and four other States. The Court referred to the findings of a Special Committee whose report had been adopted by an Advisory and Technical Committee of the League of Nations. It said: “The Court is fully aware that the Romanian Government has refused to accept the facts established by the Committee... but the Court is of opinion that, for the purposes of the present procedure, it must accept the findings of the Committee on issues of fact unless in the records submitted to the Court there is evidence to refute them.”\n\nIn the present case there is not one report but many, the reports of competent bodies including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Human Rights Committee, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and so on. They are in the Secretary-Generals dossier and have been supplemented by others. They tell a concordant story. The Court is perfectly well informed.\n\nIf Israel wished to challenge the circumstances and facts set out in these reports it could have done so, as Romania did in European Commission of the Danube. Israel cannot plead lack of facts as a ground to have the Court refuse to decide, when any deficiency in the facts could have been corrected by Israel itself. Israel does not have a veto, any more than Spain did in Western Sahara — and if a veto in principle does not exist then it cannot be created by the back door of refusing to present substantive arguments.\n\nAnyway the basic facts are perfectly clear. The dominant fact is the US$2billion fact of the Wall, growing daily and dividing Palestinian communities from each other and from their lands and water. That is the essential fact, this US$2billion so-called “temporary” edifice. So much is now known about the Wall, and what is not known can be deduced from its route, its size, its cost, its régime, its effects and the avowed intentions of those who are building it to impose a unilateral settlement."

      "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto":"Mr. President, Members of the Court, it is my honour to address you on behalf of Palestine. I wish to thank the International Court of Justice for granting Palestine the opportunity to participate in these advisory proceedings on the “Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.\n\nI stand before you as a representative of the Palestinian people, the indigenous people of the land, who for too long have been denied the right to self-determination and sovereignty over their land and half of whom remain refugees. The Palestinian people have been subject to a military occupation for almost 37 years. They have been dehumanized and demonized, humiliated and demeaned, dispossessed and dispersed, and brutally punished by their occupier. The occupation has systematically denied them their basic rights and freedoms and has controlled almost every single aspect of their lives.\n\nThis case, however, is not about the whole of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — it is about the Wall. This Wall is being constructed almost entirely in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This Wall is not about security: it is about entrenching the occupation and the de facto annexation of large areas of Palestinian land. This Wall, if completed, will leave the Palestinian people with only half of the West Bank within isolated, non-contiguous, walled enclaves. It will render the two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict practically impossible.\n\nThe Wall is not just a physical structure; it is a whole régime. It encircles entire communities in walled enclaves and, if completed, will wall-in most of the Palestinian population. It is already causing the displacement of Palestinian civilians and has imprisoned thousands of Palestinians between it and the Armistice Line of 1949, the Green Line. There is, moreover, without a doubt, a correlation between the route of the Wall and the illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the water resources in the area.\n\nThere is also, of course, a correlation between the route of the Wall and Israels long-standing illegal policies and practices with regard to Jerusalem. East Jerusalem is occupied territory. The international community has never recognized Israels illegal annexation of East Jerusalem. The route of the Wall will clearly entrench this annexation. It will compound the humanitarian hardships being faced by the Palestinian inhabitants of the city. Moreover, it will isolate the city from the rest of the Palestinian population, obstructing their access to the city and its Holy Places.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, there has been no shortage of peace initiatives on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet, since the adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), and throughout every one of the subsequent initiatives, Israel has simultaneously been engaged in the intensive colonization of our land. It has transferred 400,000 illegal settlers to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. It is continuously attempting to change the status, physical character, nature and demographic composition of that territory, most recently through its construction of the Wall. Actually, since the signing in 1993 of the Declaration of Principles between the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, Israel not only continued its illegal settlement activities and expansion but actually doubled the number of its settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. Doubled. How can it be expected that the Palestinian people would continue to believe that peace was imminent under such circumstances?\n\nThere is near unanimity among the States in the world that building this Wall is unacceptable. The overwhelming majority of Member States believe that it is in contradiction to international law. The same overwhelming majority believes, as one group, the European Union, has officially declared, that the Wall renders “the two-State solution physically impossible”. Saving the Road Map thus and the prospects for peace requires a cessation of the construction of this Wall, its removal and non-recognition by States of any of its consequences.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, I wish now to address the issue of the suicide bombings, the security situation and Israels policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel claims that the construction of the Wall is a temporary defensive measure to prevent suicide bombings and provide security for Israel. This is not true, and the proof is simple. If this were in fact the case, then Israel would have constructed the Wall on its territory along the Armistice Line of 1949 and not in departure of the Armistice Line and almost entirely in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. If Israel wanted a Wall for security, it could construct it on its territory and raise it to 80 m rather than 8 m if it wished. This would not bode well for mutual coexistence of course, but no one would challenge its legality in principle.\n\nThe suicide bombings have led to the death of 438 Israelis in Israel. Four hundred and ninety Israelis, mostly soldiers and settlers, have also been killed by other kinds of violence. In contrast, since September 2000 and as of 18 February 2004, the Israeli occupying forces have directly killed, including many by extrajudicial execution, a total of 2,770 Palestinian civilians, including children, women and men. Of those killed, more than 1,200 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli occupying forces in the Gaza Strip, even though Israel has already built another kind of wall surrounding the Gaza Strip. The question that must be asked is: how then will this Wall being built by Israel solve the security problem? If anything, its route and the illegal measures entailed in its construction ensure that it will actually exacerbate the security situation. It is more than obvious that when you deprive an entire people of their rights, expropriate their land and property and wall them into enclaves and ghettos, you are not solving the security problem but creating an untenable situation that will combust.\n\nAt this time, I wish to make our position vis-à-vis the suicide bombings very clear. We have consistently, repeatedly and unequivocally condemned these bombings. We condemn any violence directed at civilians in this conflict, whether Israeli or Palestinian. We consider the suicide bombings to be unlawful. They are also harmful to the just and honourable cause of the Palestinian people.\n\nThat said, I draw attention to the fact that the first suicide bombing occurred nearly 27 years after the onset of this oppressive military occupation of the Palestinian people. This phenomenon is the result of Israeli policies and measures, including the relentless colonization of our land. It is not the cause of those policies and measures. It is also imperative that a distinction be made between such unlawful acts of violence against Israeli civilians in Israel and acts of Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation and to military attacks by the occupying forces, consistent with international law. Nevertheless, Palestine reaffirms its commitment to a peaceful, negotiated solution to end this occupation and end this conflict.\n\nThere is a humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Serious violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law are being committed. The Wall, part and parcel of these violations and breaches, is severely exacerbating this situation. How can the Road Map truly succeed under such circumstances? It cannot. How can Israel expect the Palestinian side to be able to act effectively when it has destroyed Palestinian security capabilities and has confined the leader of the Palestinian people and elected President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, for more than two years, undermining the leaderships ability to properly function? It cannot. How can Israels construction of this Wall and its continued confiscation and colonization of the Palestinian land lead to peace and security for both peoples? It cannot.\n\nThe colonization by Israel of the Palestinian land under its occupation and the attempts to change its legal status are not new phenomena. What is new, however, is the magnitude of Israels attempt to change the legal status and to effect the de facto annexation of large parts of the Occupied Territory by means of the Wall. The Wall will be the culmination of all previous illegal measures and practices carried out by Israel since 1967 towards that end. It will destroy the hopes of the Palestinian people for the realization of their inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination, and destroy their faith in the rule of international law and the international communitys ability to uphold it in the face of such grievous violations. It will destroy the hopes of the international community for implementation of the Road Map and the “two-State” solution of Israel and Palestine, both living side by side within secure and recognized boundaries. Such a lamentable outcome must be avoided at all costs.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, this factual presentation is in two parts. I will describe the nature and route of the Wall. Then, I will outline its effects at the local, regional and national levels. This presentation is based on reports included in the United Nations dossier before you. I am joined by Professor Jarat Chopra of Brown University.\n\nThe nature and route of the wall\n\nNow, let me turn to the nature and route of the Wall. The Wall complex varies in width between 30 m and 100 m, with closed military zones on either side. As the slide indicates, the Wall complex includes a number of components: stacks of coils of barbed and razor wire, trenches, an electrified fence with automatic sensors, a paved road for Israeli patrols, a sand trace path to detect footprints, a dirt area, and surveillance cameras.\n\nIn some places, the Wall is made of concrete and is 8 m high, including around Occupied East Jerusalem. In Qalqilya, the concrete Wall is lined with watch towers approximately 300 m apart.\n\nGates are also one of the features of the Wall. According to the United Nations, there are 37 gates built into the Wall. Approximately half of these gates are not operating. Some gates open for short 15-minute intervals only two or three times a day. However, the opening times change unpredictably and Palestinians have to wait for soldiers to open the locks. A number of gates have never been opened, like the one shown on this slide.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-Generals reports divide construction of the Wall into four phases. A fifth phase of construction is projected, as noted by the United Nations Special Rapporteur and the Commission on Human Rights. On this map, the blue represents Israeli settlements. Phase A of the Wall is completed and is illustrated by the solid red line. This phase extends from Salem to the Israeli settlement of “Elkana”. Phase A also includes two sections of the Wall north and south of Jerusalem. Phase B extends from the Jordan River and south to Tayasir. This latter portion is the beginning of an Eastern Wall. A majority of Phase B has been completed, and the broken red lines indicate areas either approved or under construction. Phase C of the Wall extends from the settlement of “Elkana” to Jerusalem. Much of the current construction is occurring in this phase. Phase D has been approved and will extend from the Israeli settlement of “Gilo” to the south-east of Hebron. A fifth phase in the east is projected to extend along the entire Jordan Valley.\n\nIf completed, the total length of the Wall will be between 700 km and 800 km, and it will enclose some 56.5 per cent of the West Bank inside the Wall.\n\nThis slide illustrates how the Wall significantly deviates from the Green Line in Occupied East Jerusalem. It weaves in and around the Palestinian population, residing in areas indicated in grey, separating Palestinian from Palestinian. It also creates enclaves of Palestinian populated areas and isolates East Jerusalem from the remainder of the West Bank. The Wall denies worshippers access to holy sites in Jerusalems Old City. You can also see how the Wall extends around Israeli settlements, which are shown in blue on the map.\n\nThe relationship between the route of the Wall and settlement expansion is clearly illustrated in the Qalqilya area. The Wall has been routed around the planned expansion areas of the “Zufin” and “Alfe Menashe” settlements, as shown by the light blue. The Wall is also routed around the roads that link the settlements with each other and to Israel, as shown by the light blue lines. The result of this pattern is the enclosure of Qalqilya.\n\nNot only in Qalqilya, but throughout the West Bank, the route of the Wall corresponds to Israeli settlements. The dark blue represents existing settlements. The light blue represents planned settlement expansion areas. The grey represents the jurisdictional areas of settlements, which are reserved for future settlement expansion and other settlement activities. The route of the Wall, in red, corresponds to these Israeli settlement areas.\n\nThe effects of the Wall\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, I would now like to draw your attention to the effects of the Wall at the local, regional, and national levels.\n\nAt the local level, Palestinians are being separated from their land and deprived of their water resources. On this map, the Green Line is indicated. The yellow line represents Palestinian village boundaries. The brown areas are agricultural areas. The blue circles are water wells. And the red line is the Wall weaving its way through the West Bank. The blue areas are Israeli settlements and the dotted blue lines again represent planned settlement expansion.\n\nJayyus is a village of approximately 3,000 people, the majority of whom depend on farming. Approximately two thirds of the village land is now situated to the west of the Wall, separating villagers from their land and water wells. Consequently, these farmers of Jayyus are no longer investing in their land. The picture on the right is a view from Jayyus of its land on the other side of the Wall.\n\nAt the regional level, the Wall has also had a serious impact. For instance, due to the complete enclosure of Qalqilya by the Wall and a gate, some one third of the shops have closed and unemployment rates have increased. The impact on the villages dependent upon Qalqilya has also been severe. Peoples access to basic services has declined dramatically. For example, a United Nations hospital in Qalqilya has experienced a 40 per cent decrease in caseloads since the enclosure of Qalqilya and the surrounding areas. Both Qalqilya and the neighbouring villages are separated from almost all of their agricultural land in what is considered to be part of the “Bread basket” of the West Bank. Because of these conditions, Palestinians are leaving the area.\n\nThe Wall is also disrupting access to education. These photographs illustrate students at gates waiting for Israeli soldiers to open the locks and allow them through.\n\nAt the national level, a significant portion of the water fields will be situated outside of the Wall, as shown by the shaded areas on the left map. Consequently, Palestinian capacity to develop the national economy and agricultural base will be significantly curtailed.\n\nAs shown by the map on the right, main urban centres throughout the West Bank are being isolated by the construction of the Wall. As in the case of Qalqilya, the capacity of these main centres to provide regional services and to drive economic development is being extensively eroded by the Wall. The Wall is also rerouteing the movement of goods and people, significantly increasing travel times.\n\nExacerbating the existing effects caused by the Wall, Israel has issued military orders declaring the area between the Wall and the Green Line a “Closed Zone”. According to these military orders, Palestinian residents over the age of 12 within the Closed Zone must apply for a permit to live in their own homes and remain on their land. In addition, Palestinians living inside the Wall wishing to access their land, to work or visit relatives in the Closed Zone must obtain access permits. Israeli citizens are exempt from this permit system. Significantly, obtaining a permit to enter the Closed Zone does not guarantee access because of gate closures. Altogether these procedures are causing Palestinians to leave their homes. Thank you, Mr. President, Members of the Court.\n\nThe Assembly has determined in resolution ES 10/13 that the Wall is “in departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law”. That resolution does not, however, answer all questions; it leaves open important questions. For example, in what respects, and under which rules of international law, is the Wall illegal? What must be done to restore the situation to legality? And what are the duties of States in the meantime?\n\nI have three main points to put before the Court:\n\nfirst, that Israel has, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, only the rights of an Occupying Power, which are conferred by and limited by international law, and that the construction and operation of the Wall does not fall within those rights;\n\nsecond, that Israel, as the Occupying Power, is legally bound to ensure the rights prescribed by international law for those persons lawfully resident in Palestine, and that the Wall violates those rights; and\n\nthird, that the effect of the Wall is to change the status of the Territory in a manner tantamount to annexation, in violation of international law.\n\nLet me begin with the underlying question of the legality of the Wall. The issue here is not whether Israel has the right to build a wall: it is whether it has the right to build the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Palestines main point is that whatever security effects the Wall might have could be secured by building the Wall along the Green Line, on Israeli territory, so that there is no legal justification for building it in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nAs you have already seen, the construction of the Wall has involved both the taking of land and the destruction of Palestinian property in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Under international law the requisitioning of land and the destruction of property are permissible only within narrow and closely defined limits.\n\nRequisitioning of land is governed by Article 52 of the 1907 Hague Regulations, which stipulates that “requisitions in kind and services shall not be demanded from municipalities or inhabitants except for the needs of the army of occupation”.\n\nIsrael admits that the route of the Wall is designed to protect Israeli civilian settlements which have been built in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. It has explicitly said so, for example in the confiscation notice which is quoted beneath photograph 9 in Volume 1 of the Annex to our Written Statement. In any event, the map speaks for itself. The Wall departs from the Green Line in order to fix the settlements on what is no doubt thought of as the “Israeli” side of the line. Perhaps the most striking examples are in the areas around Qalqilya and the Israeli settlement “Ariel”, and in and around East Jerusalem.\n\nThose settlements were themselves created in violation of international law. Article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits the transfer by an Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the occupied territory. As a Legal Adviser to the United States State Department said, in relation to Israeli settlement policy, that prohibition “extends clearly to reach such involvements of the occupying power as determining the location of settlements, making land available and financing of settlements, as well as other kinds of assistance and participation in their creation” (paras. 464 and 465 of Palestines Written Statement). He concluded that Israel was in breach of that prohibition. Numerous Security Council and General Assembly resolutions have determined that the settlement activities breach international law.\n\nNow the breach is a serious matter. It is declared to be a “grave breach” of international law by Article 85 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions.\n\nThe logic is inescapable. The civilian settlements are unlawful. Therefore there is no right to divert the Wall from the Green Line in order to protect those unlawful settlements. Therefore the confiscations of Palestinian land for that purpose violate international humanitarian law. The Wall, away from the Green Line, has been constructed, and Palestinian property has been taken, for a legally impermissible purpose. There is no need to examine security concerns and arguments in depth in order to appraise the legality of those diversions.\n\nSimilarly, the destruction of Palestinian property for the purpose of constructing the Wall is far removed from anything that is, in the words of Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, “rendered absolutely necessary by military operations”. There are no such military operations, in the sense in which Article 53 of the Convention uses the term. Indeed the route of the Wall sometimes seems to have been devised with a view to the infliction of wanton damage. The photograph is of the former market of Nazlat Issa, on which the livelihood of hundreds of Palestinian families depended. It was destroyed by the Israeli army “out of necessity to protect Israeli settlements in the area”. The nearest Israeli settlement is 4 km away.\n\nOn this point, Palestine accordingly respectfully suggests that the Court should advise the General Assembly that the building and operation of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, violates international law.\n\nThe impact of the Wall on the basic human rights of the men, women and children in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is graphically illustrated in the United Nations reports, and by the reports of BTselem, the Israeli human rights organization.\n\nThere are two broad categories of violations. First, there are the direct seizures of land and destruction of property that the construction of the Wall entails. And those I have addressed already. Second, there are the rights that are violated as a result of the restrictions on the movement and residence of the Palestinian population that are imposed under the régime of the Wall. These violations affect the entire population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, not simply those whose property is taken or those who have been walled in by the Israeli Government.\n\nThe scale of those violations must be understood. This is not a technical squabble over Israeli trespass on Palestinian land. Three of the United Nations reports within the last year (the Bertini37, Dugard38 and Ziegler39 reports) concluded that there is a humanitarian crisis their words, not mine in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and one that is man-made.\n\nWe had intended to take the Court to passages in those reports that epitomise conduct in clear violation of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. We understand, however, the Courts desire to focus at this stage on law rather than facts; and last Wednesday the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement which captures the essence of what we, and the various United Nations and other reports, are trying to communicate and fixes it precisely in its legal context. It states the following:\n\n“The ICRC is increasingly concerned about the humanitarian impact of the West Bank Barrier on many Palestinians living in occupied territory. Where it deviates from the ‘Green Line into occupied territory, the Barrier deprives thousands of Palestinian residents of adequate access to basic services such as water, health care and education, as well as sources of income such as agriculture and other forms of employment. The Palestinian communities situated between the ‘Green Line and the Barrier are effectively cut off from the Palestinian society to which they belong. The construction of the West Bank Barrier continues to give rise to widespread appropriation of Palestinian property and extensive damage to or destruction of buildings and farmland. The ICRC has repeatedly condemned deliberate attacks against Israeli civilians and stressed that all acts intended to spread terror among the civilian population are in clear violation of international humanitarian law (IHL). It recognizes Israels right to take measures to ensure the security of its population. However, these measures must respect the relevant rules of IHL. The ICRCs opinion is that the West Bank Barrier, in as far as its route deviates from the ‘Green Line into occupied territory, is contrary to IHL. The problems affecting the Palestinian population in their daily lives clearly demonstrate that it runs counter to Israels obligation under IHL to ensure the humane treatment and well-being of the civilian population living under its occupation. The measures taken by the Israeli authorities linked to the construction of the Barrier in occupied territory go far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power under IHL. These findings are based on the ICRCs monitoring of the living conditions of the Palestinian population and on its analysis of the applicable IHL provisions. The Israeli authorities have been regularly informed about the ICRCs humanitarian and legal concerns. The ICRC therefore calls upon Israel not to plan, construct or maintain this Barrier within occupied territory.”\n\nI would respectfully direct the Courts attention to the Written Statement submitted in this case by the Swiss Government, which has a particular position as the official depository of the Geneva Conventions. It is helpful to read the words of the ICRC alongside that statement.\n\nPalestines Written Statement identifies the main provisions of international humanitarian law and international human rights law that are applicable in this context. It identifies breaches of several provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Israel has ratified. They include Articles 12, on freedom of movement, and 17 on the right to family life. There are breaches of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, also ratified by Israel, including Articles 11 and 12, on the right to food and to medical care, and Article 13 on the right to education. There are also breaches of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, again, ratified by Israel. Palestine attaches particular importance to this. Children constitute over half of the Palestinian population. The Written Statement identifies breaches of Articles 24 and 27, on the right to food and medical care, Article 28 on the right to education, and Article 16 on the right to family life.\n\nThe response of many Israeli officials has been: the Wall is the price that supporters of terrorism must pay; the solution lies in the hands of the Palestinian Authority. That is an unacceptable response, and not only because of Israels repeated incursions into the territory, its destruction of the Palestinian security apparatus and institutions, its imposition of curfews and roadblocks, and its construction of the Wall all of which steps have undermined the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe response is unacceptable first, because Israel, as Occupying Power, carries the legal responsibility to ensure basic human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It cannot claim the rights of a military occupant without accepting the corresponding responsibilities.\n\nSecond, that response is tantamount to the imposition of a collective punishment. The Palestinian Authority has consistently condemned terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians; and it is as absurd as it is offensive to imply that all Palestinians are engaged in a murderous conspiracy to attack Israel. To impose the Wall, and all the consequent restrictions on movement and access to property, jobs, welfare, education and families, as a punishment on the whole Palestinian population is unfair, unprincipled, and illegal. It appears to be, as was noted in one of the United Nations reports, a form of collective punishment in retribution for attacks on Israel40. Collective punishments are specifically prohibited by the Laws of War, under Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 75 of Additional Protocol I.\n\nThird, it is evident that the Wall, in so far as it departs from the Green Line and is built in Occupied Palestinian Territory, cannot be justified by appeals to Israels security interests. Israels legitimate interests can, as we have explained in our Written Statement, be protected by building the Wall on Israels soil; Israel has no legal right to take Palestinian land and destroy Palestinian property in order to protect unlawful settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Palestine accepts the right of every State to take protective measures. But those measures must be lawful. States cannot cast off all legal and moral constraints by merely calling on the name of “security interests”.\n\nThe question before the Court is whether the Wall, as described in the Secretary-Generals report, violates international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Our Written Statement sets out detailed submissions on this issue; but the point is a simple one. Having read the Secretary-Generals report and the reports that are appended to it, can the Court realistically say that it doubts whether Israel is violating international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory? Having read through the supporting documents put before it in response to its request to States to provide relevant information, can it say that there is no reason to believe that, as the ICRC put it, “the measures taken by the Israeli authorities linked to the construction of the Barrier in occupied territory go far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power”?\n\nPalestine respectfully suggests that the Court should advise the General Assembly that Israel is obliged to ensure for the residents of the Occupied Palestinian Territory the rights to which they are entitled under international humanitarian law and international human rights law; that those rights include the rights listed in paragraphs C, D, and E of the Order of the Court of 10 July 2004; that the Wall that Israel is building in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violates those rights; and that Israel is obliged to cease forthwith the construction of the Wall, to dismantle forthwith the structure therein situated, to repeal or render ineffective forthwith all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto, and to make reparation for all damage caused by the construction of the Wall, in accordance with international law."

      "texto": "Three specific elements of that resolution should be highlighted: First, it demanded that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is in departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law. Second, it requested the Secretary-General to report on compliance. And, third, it expressly stated that upon receipt of the first report further actions should be considered, if necessary, within the United Nations system. The wording of that third element reflected a compromise on the means of following up the issue, including the possibility of a request for an advisory opinion from this Court on the legal consequences in case of non-compliance. The phrase could not have meant anything other than a reference to the Court, and, regardless of the claim made in one Written Statement of a different understanding, it is indisputable that the idea for requesting an advisory opinion was widely discussed and debated.\n\nFollowing the resolution's adoption, Israel not only continued but accelerated its construction of the Wall on Palestinian territory. The Secretary-General, pursuant to the resolution, presented a report containing a clear factual presentation about the Wall. It concluded that Israel is not in compliance with the Assembly's demand that it stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nAccordingly, the emergency special session resumed again on 8 December 2003, and adopted by a large majority resolution ES-10/14 requesting this Court to urgently render an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from Israel's construction of the Wall.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, Israel's Written Statement to the Court claims that it does not deal with the merits of the case. We beg to differ. The Israeli statement is rife with attempts to justify the construction of the Wall through the presentation of a detailed case on terror attacks and through political arguments, including on the Road Map. Israel repeatedly refers to the Road Map and to Security Council resolution 1515 (2003). This is ironic. The Government of Israel has never wanted this Road Map, it has never wanted the Security Council's endorsement of it and has repeatedly caused the delay of both. After the Road Map was formally presented in April 2003, the Israeli Government would not say that it accepted the Road Map itself but only what it called \"the steps set out in the Roadmap\". Even then, in accordance with the Israeli Cabinet Statement of 25 May 2003, 14 reservations were attached to it.\n\nIsrael later vehemently objected to the Russian Federation initiative to bring the Road Map to the Security Council for endorsement. When Security Council resolution 1515 (2003) was finally adopted on 19 November 2003, the Council held no debate. This was due to Israel's opposition. Then, on 17 December 2003, Israel undermined the traditional consensus on a General Assembly resolution on \"Assistance to the Palestinian People\" specifically because the European Union, co-sponsoring the resolution, added a paragraph welcoming the endorsement by the Council of the Road Map in resolution 1515. Israel made its adherence to consensus on that resolution conditional upon the removal of the reference to resolution 1515, which did not occur."

      "texto": "Mr. President, Members of the Court, it is my privilege and pleasure to stand before you again today, on behalf of Palestine, to address the issue of the applicable law to the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nThis issue is treated at some length in Palestines Written Statement, so I shall limit myself to highlighting and elaborating further only on some salient points. The question put to the Court by the General Assembly focuses mainly on international humanitarian law via the reference to the Fourth Geneva Convention and by characterizing the Territory as “occupied” by reference to that law. But the rules and principles of international laws that have a bearing on the situation have a much wider scope than that. In the first place, closest to the rules and principles of international humanitarian law, and increasingly intertwined with them are those of the international law of human rights.\n\nBut there are also the general rules of international law, particularly two of its cardinal, constitutive, principles Professor Crawford has just been referring to. One of them, namely, the prohibition of the individual use of force and its corollary, the prohibition of conquest or the taking of territory by force, and the principle of equal rights of peoples and their right to self-determination. But as my colleagues Professors Vaughan Lowe and Jean Salmon will be dealing with aspects of the latter two categories and given the limitations of time, I shall concentrate my remarks on international humanitarian law, or the jus in bello.\n\nUp to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the instruments codifying these rules did not explicitly define the circumstances triggering their application. By contrast, the Geneva Conventions instructed by the experiences of the Second World War in Article 2 common to the four Conventions, state in paragraph 1: “the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them”.\n\nThe Hague Regulations, for their part, define, in Article 42, the circumstances under which “a territory is considered occupied” and these circumstances are, again according to that Article, “when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army”.\n\nThat is exactly what happened in 1967. In the course of an armed conflict between several States, Israel invaded and occupied militarily, inter alia, the West Bank and Gaza, formerly part of the British mandated territory of Palestine, which had never been before under Israeli jurisdiction or administration. In other words, an armed conflict as provided for in Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Geneva Convention, brought about a situation falling under Article 42 of the Hague Regulations. A typical case of belligerent occupation.\n\nThese are clear texts that dispose clearly of the matter. But Israel contests this conclusion on the basis of the second paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Convention, which provides: “The Convention shall also apply” so this is a second case “to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.”\n\nThis provision was added ex abundante cautela in 1949 to cover the case of occupatio pacifica, that meets with no armed resistance, like the occupation of the Suddeten in 1938. Even that is considered an occupation, and triggers the application of the Convention. But in such cases, as there is no visible armed conflict, there is a need for another criterion which explains the reference to the legal status or title to the territory thus occupied, a title which does not belong to the occupant.\n\nBut in cases of belligerent occupation, covered by the first paragraph of Article 2, what matters is the taking of control over the territory in the course of an international armed conflict, and maintaining it by military force; not the title of the entity that was peacefully administering the territory before the occupation, or any other entity that may have a claim on this. This particularly applies to claims laid by the belligerent occupant on the occupied territory. It would make a mockery of the law if an invader could evade the application of the jus in bello by merely formulating a claim on the territory it occupies by force. It would be tantamount to an invitation to annex the territory.\n\nThis rule also applies, regardless of the characterization of the use of force by the belligerent occupant, that is whether it is an alleged aggressor or allegedly exercising self-defence. For it is a cardinal principle of jus in bello that its rules apply equally to all parties, irrespective of their rights and wrongs under the jus ad bellum.\n\nI shall not go into the specific arguments of Israel relating to the non-incorporation of the Hague Rules and the Fourth Geneva Convention into its municipal law, nor on the alleged application de facto of only the humanitarian components of the Fourth Geneva Convention. After all, are there any non-humanitarian components in the Geneva Conventions? Even the procedural aspects provide guarantees for the observance of the substantive protective rules. And can one apply only de facto instruments and rules by which one is legally bound? Indeed, this august Court itself has found that both the Hague Regulations and the Geneva Conventions have passed into general international law (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I.C.J. Reports 1996, para. 79) and even characterize them as being intransgressable not to use jus cogens. As such they are universally binding, regardless of the conventional limitations that may be attached to them as treaties.\n\nThe same can be said of most of the provisions of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, in any case those provisions that may be relevant here, such as Article 75 on Fundamental Guarantees.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, I have been addressing the legal rationale of the applicability of the law of belligerent occupation to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. But this rationale, moreover, has been endorsed by almost the unanimity of the international community apart from Israel.\n\nI need not recapitulate here all the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, or of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention or the declarations of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the latest being on the 18th of this month and the ICRC is the institutional guardian of the Conventions or of the different States or groups of States. All these declarations assert the applicability de jure of the Fourth Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Palestine Written Statement, paras. 387-392). I would like simply in this respect to make a short remark on the status and role of the General Assembly and Security Council resolutions which are specifically referred to in the request for the advisory opinion.\n\nThe Israeli statement in these proceedings, in an attempt to undermine the basic role of the General Assembly, which has just been described by Professor Crawford, declares: “Resolution ES-10/13, which purports to determine illegality, cannot properly be relied upon as an authoritative determination of legality. It is not binding.” (P. 116, para. 9.9.) The Statement contrasts that resolution with Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (ibid., para. 9.10), which was referred to in the request for an advisory opinion in the Namibia case (I.C.J. Reports 1971). However, in that very Advisory Opinion on Namibia the Court has said: “it would not be correct to assume that, because the General Assembly is in principle vested with recommendatory powers, it is debarred from adopting, in specific cases within the framework of its competence, resolutions which make determinations or have operative designs”\n\nMaking determinations is part and parcel of the functions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. It is only on the basis of such determinations that they can envisage further action, on items they deal with, within the limits of their powers under the Charter. This is the quasi-judicial role of these two organs, as has been already described by the regretted Professor Oskar Scharffer already in 1964.\n\nThe Court has, on numerous occasions, particularly in advisory proceedings, recognized and acted upon such determinations by the General Assembly and the Security Council, and has never, to my knowledge at least, ignored or set aside such a determination.\n\nOf particular significance to the question put to the Court are the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council relating to settlements and the annexation of East Jerusalem and its surroundings. These resolutions, particularly several resolutions of the Security Council, adopted unanimously with the positive vote of the United States, determine I am quoting from the dispositif of such resolutions the illegality of the settlements (see Palestine Statement, paras. 165-167), and of the annexation of Jerusalem, characterizing this annexation as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that does not affect the continued applicability of that Convention to Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Territory (ibid., paras. 168, 361-364). Resolution 478 goes even further and determines that “all legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the status and character of the Holy City of Jerusalem... are null and void... and must be rescinded forthwith...”\n\nMr. President, I turn now very briefly to the content of international humanitarian law inasmuch as it regulates belligerent occupation.\n\nArticle 42 of the Hague Regulations defines belligerent occupation as a de facto status arising from the effective control of the territory by a hostile army, and extending only as far as this effective control (or “authority” as it calls it) “has been established and can be exercised”. International humanitarian law takes cognizance of this de facto status, to which it attaches legal consequences or a régime. This legal régime is guided by two major principles:\n\nThe first is that occupation is a temporary (or transient) state of affairs. It is an abnormal or emergency situation, and the law of occupation tries to strike a balance between, on the one hand, accommodating the military needs of the Occupying Power in prosecuting the war and its war aims and, on the other hand, protecting the rights, freedoms and welfare of the population of the occupied territory, as well as their normal way and train of life from being excessively disturbed and affected by the occupation.\n\nIn this respect, international humanitarian law, while recognizing to the Occupying Power the prerogatives of government over the occupied territory, imposes on it the positive obligations of government in terms of restoring and ensuring “public order and safety” (Article 43 of the Hague Regulations), as well as ensuring food and medical supplies and services for the population to the fullest extent possible (Articles 55 and 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention) as well as respecting their human rights and dignity and so forth.\n\nThe second governing principle of the law of occupation is that occupation, being a temporary, transient régime, cannot affect nor transfer sovereignty to the Occupying Power. In this respect, the régime of occupation operates to a large extent as an interim measure (une mesure conservatoire), by freezing the status juris of the occupied territory for as long and as far as occupation remains effective; so that it cannot be changed by any unilateral act or action on the part of the Occupying Power.\n\nThe legal effects of this principle are reflected in Article 47 of the Fourth Convention which provides: \n\n“Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.”\n\nBut the law of occupation goes even further. It enjoins the Occupying Power to leave things as they were before the occupation to the fullest extent possible; for example, “not [to] alter the status of public officials and judges” in Article 54 of the Geneva Convention. In the same vein, Article 43, which I have just referred to, of the Hague Regulations directs the Occupying Power to “take all measures in his power to restore and to ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety” and here is a clause I want to underline “while respecting, unless absolutely not necessarily absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country” (and the same about criminal laws in Article 64 of the same Convention).\n\nReferring to Article 43, the ICRC Commentary on the Fourth Geneva Convention says the following: “This provision of the Hague Regulations is not applicable only to the inhabitants of the occupied territory, it also protects the separate existence of the State, its institutions and its laws.”\n\nIndeed, the protection of the separate status and corporate existence of the occupied territory is reflected in the Hague Regulations by the protection they provide not only to private property (Arts. 46 and 47), but also to the commons and to public property in the form of “public buildings, real estate, forests and agricultural estates” of which “the occupying power shall be regarded only as administrator and usufructuary” and “must safeguard the capital of these properties and administer them in accordance with the rules of usufruct”.\n\nThe prohibition of effecting durable changes by the unilateral act or action of the Occupying Power is not limited to the formal legal status of the territory (through a purported change of sovereignty). It extends also to such changes in the human and material components of the occupied territorial entity whence the prohibition, in Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, of demographic changes through “individual or mass forcible transfer as well as deportation” of civilians outside the occupied territory; as well as the deportation or transfer by the Occupying Power of “parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”.\n\nThese prohibited acts constitute, under the Geneva Conventions and Article 147 particularly of the Fourth Convention, as well as Article 85 of Protocol I and Article 8 of the recent Rome Statute, grave breaches of international law which entail individual criminal responsibility.\n\nMr. President, it is by the standards of this legal régime that the legality of the Wall has to be assessed, and the justifications provided by Israel for its construction have to be weighted.\n\nOne of these justifications, self-defence, does not belong to international humanitarian law or the jus in bello, but to the jus ad bellum. Israel makes here an impermissible confusion between the two branches of the law of war that have to be kept radically apart. Once an armed conflict is brought into being, the jus in bello (or international humanitarian law) comes into play, as the lex specialis governing the ensuing situation regardless of the rules of the jus ad bellum.\n\nMoreover, logically, how can one say that a State exercises self-defence against a territory under its own military occupation, that is under its effective control, and in which it has the authority and even the obligation to “ensure public order and safety” according to Article 43 of the Hague Regulations? Can the Wall be then be justified as a military necessity? One of the great advances of international humanitarian law is that it has moved away from Clausewitzs concept of military necessity as Kriegsraison, i.e. the idea that the aims of war justify using any means considered necessary to achieve them.\n\nThat concept of military necessity is ultimately negatory of international humanitarian law. Fortunately, at least since the Hague Regulations of 1899, it has been replaced by the modern and much narrower concept of military necessity, strictly limited to the contexts in which it is expressly recognized and under the conditions set by the provision in the relevant instruments that recognizes it.\n\nThose conditions include, in particular, specificity and proportionality. It is in this sense that the Declaration of the Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention states in paragraph 5 that “the Fourth Geneva Convention, which takes fully into account imperative military necessity, has to be respected in all circumstances”\n\nThen we have to look in the Geneva Convention or the Hague Regulations. Where can we find in them a recognition of a military necessity (or even of a legitimate military need) that can be invoked to justify the Wall?\n\nIn my submission, the only possible justification for the Wall is as a safety measure taken by Israel in the exercise of its authority as an Occupying Power under Article 43 of the Hague Regulations and Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nAs my colleague Professor Vaughan Lowe will explain, neither provision justify the building of a Wall to protect civilian citizens of the Occupying Power implanted in the occupied territory. The argument that a similar barrier around Gaza has proved effective in reducing the attacks while debatable, as Ambassador Al-Kidwa has mentioned in his introductory speech still this argument, even if it were true, intentionally ignores the fact that the wall around Gaza had for purpose had for avowed purpose to seal it off hermetically; and that is what Israel is emphatically denying being the purpose and effect of the Wall in the West Bank. Why? Because if it admits that the purpose is for it to hermetically seal what is within the Wall, that will confirm all its flagrant features violative of international humanitarian law.\n\nThe Wall also starkly fails the test of necessity and proportionality as a security measure, because of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who remain unchecked on the other side of the Wall, on the western side for example. Unless of course they are made, directly or indirectly, to leave that area; which would constitute another flagrant grave breach of Article 49 of the Geneva Convention. Not much for possible justification.\n\nFinally, Mr. President, may I say in conclusion, that arguing on the basis of the law of occupation does not mean recognition or acceptance of the legality of this occupation, particularly when it turns into prolonged occupation that borders on annexation. Thank you, Mr. President."

The General Assembly has reaffirmed this in at least 25 resolutions. It is, after all, the General Assembly that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, dealt with mandated Palestine, deciding on 29 November 1947, in resolution 181 (II), to partition Palestine into two States, one Jewish and one Arab. The Arab State has, of course, not yet been realized; and thus the Palestinian people have been unable to exercise their right to self-determination. Indeed, Palestine is still not a Member State of the United Nations, but remains an observer. Since 1947, however, the General Assembly has never ceased dealing with the question of Palestine or its aspects.\n\nOver the years, in light of the Councils inaction, the General Assembly has tried to discharge its own responsibilities in line with General Assembly resolution 377 (V) of 1950. Four of its ten emergency special sessions have been on Palestine and the Middle East situation. In reaction to the last veto, the tenth emergency special session was resumed to consider the situation. Like the Security Council, the Assembly conducted a serious debate on the issue and two draft resolutions were submitted. One requested the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on the Wall. After intensive consultation and negotiations, however, the Members of the European Union introduced a draft resolution, with the understanding that the co-sponsors of the original two drafts would not insist on a vote on those drafts. The European Union co-sponsored draft resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority, on 21 October 2003, as resolution ES-10/13."

But Israel cannot once again be permitted to continue its ceaseless taking of Palestinian property and rights, under the cover of the peace process or the semblance of a peace initiative. The legal rights of the Palestinian people cannot simply be ignored or suspended whenever there is a peace process under way. That plays into the hands of extremists on both sides.

      "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
      "texto": "As the Court is aware, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has presented a Written Statement on the question before the Court. We are mindful of our duty not to simply repeat what is said there. We are also cognizant of the time pressure the Court is under and the fact that the position of many of the parties that are here touch upon similar points. Thus, in using my time today, I will not make a comprehensive statement that responds to all of the points that have been raised with which we disagree. We will let our Written Statement stand and reflect our comprehensive point of view. Rather, I propose to address one specific argument that has been raised. That argument concerns the discretion of the Court. The argument is that an advisory opinion on the question is at cross purposes to the negotiating effort, designed to bring peace in the Middle East, which is today called the Road Map. We strongly disagree with this argument. We believe it is a false argument that if accepted leads only to further disintegration of the peace process. It is hoped that by responding to this one argument we will provide the Court with “information”, as called for by Article 66 of the Statute of the Court. That is our responsibility here; it is not to argue as if this is a contentious case.\n\nBefore I proceed, however, I wish to make three preliminary observations.\n\nFirst, we take note of the highly unusual posture of the pleadings that have been presented to the Court.\n\nOn the one hand, no State or other party appearing in this matter has sought to justify in law the separation Wall that Israel is building. On the other hand, some of us that are before the Court have made the case in law that there are legal consequences of the separation Wall, or barrier, or fence, whatever it may be called and from here forward I will simply refer to it as the Wall and that those consequences arise from the conclusion that the Wall is unlawful. Since no party has argued to the contrary, we believe our conclusion is sound.\n\nOf course, a group of States argues that the Court should not render an advisory opinion on the question as the General Assembly has requested. The argument they present is similar to arguments made in other advisory opinion cases to the effect that the question is vague, or that the Court will be in danger of prejudicing negotiations or of departing from its judicial function. Such arguments have failed in the past before this Court. It is notable, however, that in the cases where such arguments are made, one often at the same time finds those same States arguing in the alternative: that is, they argue their view that the Court should not render an opinion, but they then go on to argue their position on the substance of the matter in the event that the Court proceeds to render an opinion. This is not the case here.\n\nFor instance, in the Nuclear Weapons case, seven States argued in their Written Statements that the Court should not give its opinion; of those States, six presented the alternative argument. In the present matter, these same six States provided the Court with Written Statements again arguing that the Court should not render an advisory opinion, but this time in doing so they presented no alternative argument. The copy of my prepared remarks given to the Registry contains the relevant citations.\n\nThus, the alternative argument is not presented here. The States that argue that the Court should not exercise its power to render an advisory opinion on the question before it do not argue in the alternative that if the Court does, it should find that there is a legal basis for the Wall and thus no adverse legal consequences. The question may be asked, why not? The answer, simply, is that the Wall is indefensible as a matter of law.\n\nMany States that have taken the position in their Written Statements that the Court should not render an advisory opinion on the question before it have elsewhere condemned the Wall. They have done so by their affirmative vote for General Assembly resolution ES-10/13 of October 2003, which demands that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the Wall and states it is in contradiction with international law.\n\nTherefore, the Court is in a curious position. Almost all States making written appearances before the Court hold the position that the Wall is illegal. Nonetheless, some of those States believe that the Court should not render an advisory opinion on the question before it because they say it will inhibit a negotiating process.\n\nIn our view, that is a sad commentary on the state of things. There is an internationally supported negotiating process. One side in the negotiations — that is, the Israeli side — has been and continues to deliberately enhance its position and change the territorial status quo to its benefit. It has been doing so since 1967; the Wall is the most recent manifestation. Nothing is being done about it, although almost all States say it is wrong. Whatever rhetorical exhortations may be made by the Quartet have done nothing to make Israel believe that there is an adverse consequence to taking more Palestinian land. Yet the argument is made that the General Assembly should be denied the Courts opinion on the legal consequences of the Wall — a wall that in our view denies a viable Palestinian State, denies the right of self-determination, and exacerbates the hatred that leads to increased violence.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, this attitude that the Court should not speak on this question does not make sense to us. If the Court, the highest international judicial body, cannot take a clear position on the law to guide the General Assembly on a specific request by that body as negotiations progress, it is not hard to understand the further descent into chaos and procrastination."

      "texto": "I now turn to our response to the argument that has been made that the Courts advisory opinion on the question of the legal consequences of the Wall would prejudice or hinder or be at cross-purposes to the Road Map, and thus the Court should refrain from giving its opinion. I will respond by looking at the argument from five different points of view.\n\nTo begin, the argument may be examined from what might be said to be a logical point of view. It is hard for us to understand how an advisory opinion from this Court that could inform the General Assembly and that is non-binding would truly hinder negotiations between two parties as claimed by Israel and several other States. The advisory opinion is an opinion of law, and the General Assembly believes it will be useful to its deliberations. We cannot lose sight of the fact that the purpose of the General Assemblys request for this position is to advise it in the conduct of its work, such work including the concern for human rights and self-determination, not to mention international peace and security. It is a fact that the Palestinian people have been denied the exercise of the right of self-determination for many decades, and this is a legitimate concern of the General Assembly.\n\nThe negotiations that are mandated by the Road Map do not take place in a vacuum. The interest of the General Assembly is not new. Resolution after resolution of both the General Assembly and the Security Council have been disregarded by the Occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around Jerusalem. It is the Security Council th\n\nbeginning with resolution 242 in 1967 and, later, resolution 338 of 1973 requires \n\nwithdrawal of Israel from the territory it occupied in the 1967 W\n\nbeginning with resolution 252 in 1968 considers that all legislative and administrat\n\nmeasures and actions taken by Israel, including expropriation of land and properties there\n\nwhich purport to change the legal status of Jerusalem are invalid and cannot change t\n\nstat\n\nin resolution 446 in 1979 determined that the policy and practices of Israel in establish\n\nsettlements in Palestine and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal valid\n\nand constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace\n\ndetermined in resolution 452 of 1979 that Israels settlement policy constitutes a violation\n\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.\n\nThe list goes on and on, and includes Security Council resolution 465 of 1980, which specifica\n\nreferred to Israels settlement policies as a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nIt remains for the parties to negotiate their own solution, but it is perfectly legitimate \n\nthe General Assembly to request the Court for an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of \n\nWall in the context of those resolutions and other principles of international law, and for the Co\n\nto exercise its mandate and to give its opinion.\n\nThe second point of view that I offer looks at this question chronologically over the l\n\ntwo years in light of the argument made in the Israeli Written Statement that the Gene\n\nAssemblys request is improper in light of the Security Councils endorsement of the Road Map\n\nits resolution 1515. A chronological review of the last two years shows that the Gene\n\nAssemblys request for an advisory opinion is consistent with its responsibilities and does \n\ninfringe upon those of the Security Council. The Israeli Written Statement, at paragraph 3.2, sta\n\nthat Security Council resolution 1397 of 12 March 2002 “sets the agenda for the Quartet initiativ\n\nIt is, of course, that initiative, which arose from the Madrid process, that resulted in the plan \n\ncalled the Road Map. According to paragraph 1.16 of the Israeli Written Statement, \n\nGovernment of Israel approved the construction of the Wall the very next month. Act\n\nconstruction began in June that same year.\n\nDuring 2002 and 2003 the Quartet issued communiqués following its meetings record\n\nits progress15. In the communiqué of the Quartet dated 17 September 2002, one can see \n\ncomplete Road Map16. It is true that it was not formally presented to Israel and to the Palestin\n\nAuthority until 30 April 2003, and it was not until 19 November 2003 that the Security Coun\n\npassed a resolution in which it “endorsed” the Road Map17. That is the operative w\n\n“endorsed” that is all. Throughout 2002 and 2003 the Road Map was promoted, acted up\n\ncalled upon and interpreted. Thus, leading up to the end of 2003, the Road Map was the centre\n\nthe diplomacy on this subject; but even before the Security Council endorsed it in November 20\n\nits viability had become open to question.\n\n“Determines that all measures taken by Israel to change the physical character, demographic\n\ncomposition, institutional structure or status of the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since\n\n1967, including Jerusalem, or any part thereof have no legal validity and that Israels policy and practices\n\nof settling parts of its population and new immigrants in those territories constitute a flagrant violation of\n\nthe Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and also constitute a\n\nserious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.”\n\nThe Israeli Written Statement portrays the scene as if on 19 November 2003 the Secur\n\nCouncil took a momentous action as if it had just discovered the Road Map rather t\n\nsimply endorsing something that had already been the focus of diplomacy for more than one year\n\nThe Israeli Written Statement goes further to cast the General Assembly in the role of a villain\n\ncalling for this advisory opinion a few weeks later: as if the General Assembly sought to pre-e\n\nthe powers of the Security Council making, as Israel asserts, the call for this advisory opin\n\nultra vires to the General Assembly19.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, the genesis the date of the beginning of \n\nRoad Map is not 19 November 2003. If so, the Road Map is itself internally inconsistent as\n\ncalls for a three-year process to be completed by 2005. The Road Map is a negotiating effort t\n\ndates from early 2002, receiving the endorsement (a rather modest word after all) of the Secur\n\nCouncil only recently.\n\nIn light of Israels arguments that the actions of the General Assembly are ultra vires,\n\nis useful to note what occurred in respect of the Wall in 2002 and 2003.\n\nFrom the date of approval of the Wall by the Israeli Government to the adoption by \n\nSecurity Council on 19 November 2003 of resolution 1515, the Quartet issued six communiqu\n\nOnly the last of these referred to the Wall, which was by then well along in its construction, \n\nthen only expressed general concern. Nonetheless, throughout the period there was mount\n\nevidence of the humanitarian crisis created by the Wall, the growing realization that new de fa\n\nterritorial annexation by Israel was occurring, and the increasing concern that the Wall would m\n\nnegotiations impossible. However, the Security Council did not act nor did the Quartet act\n\nconvince Israel to reverse the situation.\n\nIn light of these growing concerns, however, on 14 October 2003 the Security Coun\n\nconsidered a draft resolution20. A preambular paragraph of that draft resolution condemned “\n\nacts of violence, terror and destruction”, while an operative paragraph decided “that \n\nconstruction by Israel, the occupying Power, of a wall in the Occupied Territories departing f\n\nthe armistice line of 1949 is illegal under relevant provisions of international law and must\n\nceased and reversed”.\n\nThe draft resolution was not adopted by the Security Council but in the debate no \n\nsaid that the legal conclusion of the defeated resolution was wrong21.\n\nIt is in this context of the failure to comment on the legality of the Wall, and thus\n\nprotect the Road Map, that the Emergency Special Session was called, which resulted in a requ\n\nfor this advisory opinion. Thus, this review of recent events shows that the General Assembl\n\naction is not precipitous, it is not irresponsible, and that it is focused on the Wall, which\n\ndestructive of peace. There is no evidence in the chronology that suggests that the Road Map w\n\nbe harmed if an advisory opinion is given.\n\nWe now turn to a third point of view on the argument that an advisory opinion will h\n\nnegative consequences for the Road Map. This viewpoint looks at the issue from a practical \n\nhistorical point of view. Let us be clear, the Road Map is simply a negotiating process. It is w\n\nsupported by the international community, and that is good. However, one cannot avoid the f\n\nthat there have been other well-supported negotiating initiatives on this problem over the l\n\n40 years. I say this not to cast doubt on our commitment to the Road Map but simply to ensure t\n\nthe Road Map is seen for what it is.\n\nThe Court has been faced before with the argument that an advisory opinion o\n\nquestion before it would prejudice sensitive negotiations. It was confronted in particular with \n\nsame argument ten years ago in the Nuclear Weapons case. At paragraph 17 of that Judgment \n\nCourt said, and I quote:\n\n“The Court is aware that, no matter what might be its conclusions in \n\nopinion it might give, they would have relevance for the continuing debate on \n\nmatter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element in \n\nnegotiations on the matter. Beyond that, the effect of the opinion is a matter\n\nappreciation. The Court has heard contrary positions advanced and there are\n\nevident criteria by which it can prefer one assessment to another. That being so, \n\nCourt cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise \n\njurisdiction.”\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia respectfully submits that those same reasons apply here.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, the argument that doing something today mi\n\nprejudice something tomorrow is a feature of diplomatic life. It probably would be hard to find\n\nexperienced international diplomat who has not made that argument. As is the case here, it\n\nnormally made when we want to avoid putting the spotlight on what is happening now.\n\nWhat is happening now is that the Road Map is in trouble. We recognize that some\n\nthe Quartet come to the Court and say: do not shine the spotlight on the problem. We supp\n\nthese members work, but we believe they have seriously misread the situation. Fortunat\n\nanother member, the United Nations, and one of its organs a competent organ the Gene\n\nAssembly wants to put the spotlight on the problem and be informed of the legal consequen\n\nof Israels actions the legal consequences in light of the humanitarian crisis, the le\n\nconsequences for self-determination, and indeed, the legal consequences for international pe\n\nand security, not just for Palestine and Israel but for all States and international institutions.\n\nWhy should the spotlight be put on the problem? The spotlight should be put on \n\nproblem because the Wall is so provocative, so overreaching, so aggressive, and\n\ndisproportionate, that we believe it will be the death knell of the Road Map if it is not immediat\n\nreversed.\n\nThe Quartet knows this. Their last joint communiqué entitled “Final Quartet Stateme\n\nand dated 26 September 2003 indicated that they regarded the implementation of the Road Map\n\nstalled. The Quartet also said the settlement activity must stop, and then expressed great conc\n\nover the Wall and its effect on the Road Map23. That was the position of the Quartet in Septem\n\nof last year. What has happened since then? Since then, the Security Council did endorse the R\n\nMap, but the Wall continued to be built. The “fabric of life”, as the Israeli Written Statement ca\n\nit, has become even more intolerable for the Palestinian people, and, yes, the cycle of viole\n\ncontinues.\n\n“The Quartet members view with great concern the situation in Israel, the West Bank, and G\n\nwhich has stalled implementation of the roadmap. The Quartet members reaffirm that, in accordance with the roadmap, settlement activity m\n\nstop, and note with great concern the actual and proposed route of Israels West Bank fence, particula\n\nas it results in the confiscation of Palestinian land, cuts off the movement of people and goods, \n\nundermines Palestinians trust in the roadmap process as it appears to prejudge final borders of a fut\n\nPalestinian state.”\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, the fact that there was an Advisory Opinion\n\nSouth West Africa24 may have informed the views of some States and international organizatio\n\nIn spite of South Africas arguments that an opinion in that matter should not be issued, that did \n\ndeter the Court. The fact that the Court concluded that South Africas occupation was illegal \n\nactually have helped the process and left South Africa to conclude that its only option was to\n\nwhat was right: withdraw. Today, Namibia is an independent State.\n\nThe concerns of Spain in Western Sahara25 and those of a number of States in \n\nNuclear Weapons case26 concerning the impact of an advisory opinion on sensitive issues i\n\nsensitive process proved not to be true.\n\nThus, the argument that an advisory opinion on this question is counterproductive to \n\nRoad Map cannot be sustained. This is an advisory opinion. It is not binding, but it will inform \n\nGeneral Assembly that, by virtue of its request, has sought the Courts opinion on the quest\n\nposed.\n\nBefore moving on I must say one thing about Israels portrayal of the Road Map. To\n\nsure, stage one of the Road Map concerns terrorism directed at Israel, but it also concerns Isra\n\nprovocations against Palestine. The Road Map is not as Israel repeatedly states a document that\n\nbold letters says the first step is to eliminate all terrorist acts. What the Road Map says is that at \n\noutset of stage one, I quote: “All official Palestinian institutions end incitement against Israel”, \n\nfollowing thereafter and again I quote: “All official Israeli institutions end incitement agai\n\nPalestinians”27. The Palestinian obligation appears first on the page, but that is not an indicat\n\nthat Israel is free to continue its provocations, including the construction of the Wall, until it jud\n\nit is satisfied that official Palestinian institutions have utterly succeeded in winning the war agai\n\nterrorism.\n\nThe fourth point of view about this argument that the Road Map could be prejudiced\n\nthere is an advisory opinion is to note the vacuum of silence that accompanies the argument.\n\nThe silence I refer to is that no one says why the Road Map will be prejudiced if \n\nCourt gives an advisory opinion. Indeed, if one examines closely the words used, one finds that \n\nargument is generally hedged with phrases such as “could potentially prejudice” or “co\n\nundermine”. Thus, there is simply the qualified assertion without any reasoned support for \n\nassertion. This is all the more surprising in that such assertions are normally accompanied b\n\nreference to the Road Map as something that needs to be restarted not as something that is act\n\nand vibrant and moving along. That the Road Map needs to be “relaunched,” the term used by \n\nEuropean Union28, there is no doubt; that this is a difficult and sensitive and long-stand\n\nproblem, there is no doubt; but no reason is given as to why an advisory opinion would make it \n\nmore difficult.\n\nWe agree that the Road Map needs to be reinvigorated, but there is no basis \n\nconcluding that an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the Wall hinders that possibility.\n\nThe fifth and final point of view concerning the argument that the Court should \n\npronounce upon matters that are the subject of negotiations considers the argument in light of \n\nlegal context.\n\nMr. President and Members of the Court, this Israeli position needs to be carefu\n\nconsidered because it is particularly counter-productive and not in accord with international l\n\nIn fact, what Israel is saying is that the Court should not examine the Wall in the context of \n\nmany resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations \n\nshould it examine treaties to which Israel is a party based upon facts supplied by the Uni\n\nNations or the Conference of the Parties to that treaty.\n\nThe fact is that the Security Council and the General Assembly, and the Conference\n\nthe Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention29, have spoken to some of the core issues at the he\n\nof this matter. In any objective sense it is not prejudicial to the Road Map if the Court exami\n\nthe Wall against those resolutions and treaty obligations. If Israel believes the Road Map will\n\nprejudiced if the Court does no more than review a fact namely, the Wall and this is no\n\ncomplex factual question in light of the resolutions of the United Nations, custom\n\ninternational law and Israels treaty obligations, that is a serious problem. That is a seri\n\nproblem for the peace process. It is a serious problem because what it means is that so much t\n\nhas gone before is in Israels view irrelevant. Israel would prefer to live in a world where \n\nInternational Court of Justice has not spoken on these same questions.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem by force in 1967. The use\n\nforce is illegal under the United Nations Charter. The Security Council called for withdrawal\n\nIsrael in resolutions 242 of 1967 and 338 of 1973, but it has not occurred. Into the territory\n\noccupied by force Israel moved its settlers. That is fundamentally illegal under international law\n\nmatter what the justification for the occupation might be; it was confirmed by the Security Coun\n\nto apply in this instance; but Israel argues to the contrary.\n\nFurther, while it holds Palestinian territory by force, Israel denies the Palestinian peo\n\ntheir human rights and denies it is an Occupying Power subject to international humanitarian l\n\nand denies that it has obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, notwithstanding decisi\n\nof the Security Council and the General Assembly and the Conference of the Parties to the Fou\n\nGeneva Convention to the contrary. Israel even takes issue in its Written Statement with the f\n\nthat the question before the Court uses the phrase “Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in \n\naround East Jerusalem”30.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, the international community through the politi\n\ninstitutions of the United Nations and through the bodies that govern international humanitar\n\nlaw have spoken and they have spoken to Israel. There is not a word in the Written Statement\n\nsuggest that the Advisory Opinion is unnecessary because the Wall and the Settlements are \n\nin violation of international law, and there is not a word in the Written Statement to suggest t\n\nthe Advisory Opinion is unnecessary because Israel respects the resolutions of the Security Coun\n\nand the General Assembly and the Treaty obligations of Israel.\n\nIn conclusion, the fact that there are negotiations on the Road Map does not mean that \n\nCourt should not act. The Court is an organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly is\n\norgan of the United Nations. It is perfectly legitimate for the General Assembly to ask the Court \n\nits opinion on the legal consequences of the Wall in light of the situation of the Territor\n\noccupied by Israel. It is perfectly legitimate for the Court to give an opinion on the le\n\nconsequences of the Wall in light of the applicable international law, including the applica\n\nUnited Nations resolutions and the applicable treaties. If there are negotiations underway that\n\nall the more reason for the Court to act. If the negotiations are to have any chance of success, it\n\nessential that they proceed on the basis of an accurate understanding of the law. The Court is\n\norgan that has as its very purpose the giving of legal advice to the General Assembly and ot\n\norgans of the United Nations. It should give its advice when asked to do so and do so in light\n\nthe relevant facts and the relevant law. That is what is being asked of it in this case, and that\n\nwhat it should do."

      "texto": "It is important that the record show that Saudi Arabia condemns terrorism in all of its forms. We are committed to the fight against terrorism. We are a party to relevant multilateral and regional conventions and have embraced Security Council resolution 1373 of 2001. However, as we have said in many fora, it is not enough just to condemn terrorism and fight terrorism. If one wishes to defeat terrorism, one needs also to address the motivation and the provocation that lead to terrorism. As our Foreign Minister, His Royal Highness Prince Saud al-Faisal said last year during the General Debate at the General Assembly:/n/n“[T]his international effort directed against terrorism will not eradicate this phenomenon if handled without addressing its roots./n/nThe deteriorating situation of peoples who are suffering oppression, injustice and persecution, or who are overburdened by occupation, and the inability of the international community, for one reason or another, to find just solutions for these problems, is what creates the environment that is exploited by evildoers...” This is part of the issue of terrorism./n/nA third preliminary point is to emphasize the constructive role and the interest of Saudi Arabia in the success of the Road Map. Indeed, the Road Map refers specifically to the initiative of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah which was endorsed by the Beirut Arab League Summit of March 20026 that calls for acceptance of Israel as a neighbour living in peace and security, in the context of a just and equitable settlement. The Road Map refers to the Saudi initiative as “a vital element of international efforts to promote a comprehensive peace on all tracks”. Any student of this conflict will recognize that this initiative constitutes a major stride towards peace. We accept two States living side by side in harmony based upon a negotiated settlement./n/nSaudi Arabia is party to a number of multilateral conventions against terrorism including: Convention of the Organization of the Islamic Conference on Combating International Terrorism, adopted at Ouagadougou (1 July 1999); Arab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, signed at a meeting held at the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States in Cairo (22 April 1998); Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, signed at Montreal (1 March 1991); Protocol on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal (24 February 1988); International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations (17 December 1979); Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal (23 September 1971); Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at the Hague (16 December 1970); and Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo (14 September 1963)/n/nThus, Mr. President and Members of the Court, our criticism of the Wall cannot be viewed as supporting terrorism or as undermining the Road Map. To the contrary, we believe an advisory opinion on the question presented will contribute to the objective of eliminating terrorism and to bringing about a just and lasting peace in the region./n/nBefore continuing, however, in the light of the importance that has been attached to the Road Map in the presentations made to the Court, and given the importance of the Saudi initiative to the Road Map, it is important to be very clear about what was decided at the Beirut Summit. The Saudi Arabian proposal, formulated in a speech by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah, said:/n/n“The only acceptable objective of the peace process is the full Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with [East Jerusalem] as its capital, and the return of refugees. Without moving towards this objective, the peace process is an exercise in futility and a play on words and a squandering of time which perpetuates the cycle of violence.”/n/nThus it was proposed, and again I quote: “Normal relations and security for Israel in exchange for a full withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, recognition of an independent Palestinian state with [East Jerusalem] as its capital, and the return of refugees.” This proposal was adopted unanimously; and as noted, it is referred to as “a vital element” of the Road Map."

      "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
      "texto": "A matter that has been raised by all those that contest the jurisdiction of the Court is the fact that the Court has a discretion to decide whether or not to give an advisory opinion. This fact cannot be contested as Article 65, paragraph 1, clearly states that the Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body that may, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, make such a request.\n\nIn this regard, the position of the Court in the case concerning the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First Phase, Advisory Opinion (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 72) is noted. The discretion therefore undoubtedly exists. The question that begs answering, though, is how the Court should exercise this discretion in such a manner that it remains faithful to the requirements of its judicial character.\n\nOne of the main issues raised by the opponents of the Courts jurisdiction, is the lack of the judicial propriety for the Court if it accedes to the request to give an advisory opinion. This position appears to be based on a number of grounds, inter alia, the following:\n\nthe lack of consent to the jurisdiction of the Court by Israel;\nthe question relates to a substantive dispute between the parties;\nthe fact that this is a political and not a legal question;\nthe alleged ultra vires nature of the request;\nthe assumption that any opinion on this matter will serve no purpose, and will be harmful to achieving a settlement of the conflict;\nthe lack of facts before the Court due to the withdrawal by Israel to participate in the hearing.\n\n“Propriety” is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as “correctness concerning standards of behaviour or morals; the details or rules of conventionally accepted behaviour; appropriateness; rightness”. Based on the reasons that follow, we immediately conclude that there can be no doubt that it is correct and appropriate for the Court to give an advisory opinion in this case. If the arguments against the Courts jurisdiction are weighed one by one, the only logical conclusion is the unquestionable jurisdiction of the Court to issue an advisory opinion in the present case. We will now deal with some of these arguments individually.\n\nThe lack of consent to the jurisdiction of the Court by Israel\n\nBy virtue of being a Member of the United Nations, a State and, in this particular case Israel, accepts the possibility of the General Assembly requesting an advisory opinion from the Court in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and the Statute of the Court on a legal question.\n\nThe Court, in the Namibia case, emphasized the aforementioned principle by stating:\n\n“South Africa, as a Member of the United Nations, is bound by Article 96 of the Charter, which empowers the Security Council to request advisory opinions on any legal question” (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 23, para. 31).\n\nA number of States, in their written opinions or submissions, have used the Eastern Carelia case as authority that “no State can, without its consent, be compelled to submit its disputes with other States either to mediation or arbitration, or to any other kind of pacific settlement” (Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 5, p. 27). However, this case needs to be distinguished from the present, as all Member States of the United Nations by virtue of acceding to the Charter have accepted the competence of the United Nations organs to refer matters to the Court for advisory opinions.\n\nFurthermore, Article 65, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court provides that: “The Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request.”\n\nArticle 96, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter stipulates that: “The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.”\n\nThese two provisions establish the competence of the General Assembly to request an advisory opinion from the Court and also the competence of the Court to give the requested opinion on any legal question. The choice of “any” in both Articles makes the Courts jurisdiction quite expansive and circumscribed by whether the issue at hand is a legal question.\n\nThe advisory opinion has been requested by the General Assembly in line with Article 96, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter. This provision does not require the General Assembly to obtain the consent of any party before it requests an advisory opinion from the Court.\n\nThe Court, in the Western Sahara case (I.C.J. Reports 1975) affirmed that its competence to give an opinion did not depend on the consent of the interested States, even when the case concerned a legal question actually pending between them. An instance where the Court would refuse to render an opinion is when the circumstances disclose that to give a reply would have the effect of circumventing the principle that a State is not obliged to allow its disputes to be submitted to judicial settlement without its consent.\n\nThe lack of consent to the giving of an advisory opinion from any particular State is not relevant to the jurisdiction of the Court to provide the requested opinion. As the Court said in its Advisory Opinion on the Applicability of Article VI, Section 22, of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations:\n\n“The jurisdiction of the Court... to give advisory opinions on legal questions, enables United Nations entities to seek guidance from the Court in order to conduct their activities in accordance with law. These opinions are advisory, not binding. As the opinions are intended for the guidance of the United Nations, the consent of States is not a condition precedent to the competence of the Court to give them.” (I.C.J. Reports 1989, pp. 188-189, para. 31; emphasis added.)\n\nSimilar views were expressed in the earlier case of the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania case (I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 71). A clear distinction has always been maintained between contentious cases on the one hand and advisory opinions on the other. In the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons case this Court has gone even further to say that:\n\n“[I]t is not for the Court itself to purport to decide whether or not an advisory opinion is needed by the Assembly for the performance of its functions. The General Assembly has the right to decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own needs.” (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996[I], p. 237, para. 16.)\n\nFurthermore, this Court has found in the Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania case, that an opinion cannot be refused solely because the General Assembly might act ultra vires, as the General Assembly has the right to request opinions which it believes will be useful to it in the exercise of its functions. The competence of the General Assembly to request an advisory opinion, therefore, cannot be doubted on the ground that the opinion sought will not contribute to the performance of its functions.\n\nThis Court finds that the lack of consent to the giving of an advisory opinion by any particular State cannot in any way restrict the jurisdiction of the Court to give the requested advisory opinion. The Court finds that the criteria for giving an advisory opinion are clearly stated in Article 65, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court and Article 96, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter and that the General Assembly in requesting an opinion from the Court is well within its competence as provided for by these Articles."

      "pregunta": "Decides to comply with the request for an advisory opinion",
      "texto": "In answering this question, it is instructive to recall and to reflect on the Courts own views on this matter. The main aspect arising from the Courts earlier consideration of how it should exercise its jurisdiction is the fact that the Court should in principle not refuse to give an advisory opinion. This the Court stated in the Interpretation of Peace Treaties case. The Court expressed itself thus.\n\n“[t]he Court has constantly been mindful of its responsibilities as ‘the principal judicial organ of the United Nations... When considering each request, it is mindful that it should not, in principle, refuse to give an advisory opinion. In accordance with the consistent jurisprudence of the Court, only ‘compelling reasons could lead it to such a refusal.” (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, I.C.J. Reports 1996(I), p. 235, para. 140.)\n\nThe Court then declared that there has been no refusal in the history of the present Court, based on the discretionary power of the Court, to act upon a request for an advisory opinion. In fact, the Court has never refused to give an advisory opinion whenever all the other requirements for the exercise of this jurisdiction have been met. In sum, the Court asserted quite strongly that it will not take lightly a decision to refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe question should then be what are the “compelling reasons” that need to exist in order for the Court to decide not to issue an advisory opinion?\n\nOne may here indicate that perhaps being able to tease out examples of these “compelling” reasons may be made somewhat difficult by the very fact that there has been no refusal of an exercise of discretion on this ground. That notwithstanding, what is positive therefrom is that this fact underscores the very point that the Court has made repeatedly, which is that it will not lightly or readily refuse to exercise this jurisdiction.\n\nThe Court should not shy away from its obligation where an opportunity presents itself to provide advice, based on solid legal principles, especially when faced with a unique situation of international concern like the one we have here today, in respect of which there have been clear indications of the horrendous effects that the Wall has on the Palestinian people.\n\nThe lack of facts before the Court\n\nWith regard to the argument that there is a lack of facts before the Court, the Court needs to determine “whether it has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact, the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character” (Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975, pp. 28–29, para. 46).\n\nIn the present case there are no disputed facts that we must emphasize. The Court has before it the two reports: that of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and that of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories occupied by Israel. The existence of the Wall is an undisputed fact that is bound to have legal consequences in terms of the rules and principles of international law as provided for in the question put to the Court and on which the Court should pronounce itself.\n\nIn the Namibia case, the Government of South Africa argued that: “Since the Court may only give an Advisory Opinion on a legal question, it may consequently be doubted whether it is entitled to furnish an Opinion if, in order to do so, it also has to make findings as to primary facts.” (Statement submitted by the Government of the Republic of South Africa, Vol. 1, p. 143, para. 45). The Court rejected this argument completely (I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 27, para. 40).\n\nAs a matter of policy a Member State should not be allowed to undermine the judicial function of the Court by refusing to place facts it considers essential before the Court, and then benefit from this situation by seeking to use it as a means of denying the Court jurisdiction. Such a stratagem is, in our view, so simple and transparent that it falls to be rejected out of hand by the Court."

      "texto": "Applicability of international humanitarian law\n\nThere is no doubt that the Geneva Conventions apply to the 1967 armed conflict. Israels obligations as an Occupying Power in the Palestinian Territory are governed by rules and principles of international law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law. The general framework of international law governing occupation as contained in the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Fourth Geneva Convention, is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory and to Israel as the Occupying Power. Israel is a party to the four Geneva Conventions and it is widely accepted that the Hague Regulations of 1907 are declaratory of general international law, as confirmed by the Court in its Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion.\nFurthermore, the United Nations General Assembly reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territories, in its resolution A/RES/56/60 of 14 February 2002.\n\nDe facto annexation\n\nThe de facto consequence of the construction of the separation Wall, which deviates from the Green Line, which represents the actual boundary between Israel and Palestine, is that that area will be annexed and incorporated within the territory of Israel. This de facto annexation is an attempt to create facts on the ground that will be difficult to change. Such a construction not only violates various Security Council resolutions, but is also in direct breach of the rule of customary international law against the acquisition of territory by force or annexation. In international law, annexation of this kind is tantamount to conquest, which was banned by the prohibition of the use of force contained in Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter. Furthermore, the construction of the separation Wall violates one of the fundamental rules of international humanitarian law as laid out in Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, under which the rights of persons living in occupied territories are fully protected by international law. The Occupying Power, in this case Israel, may not alter their legal situation by either a unilateral act or annexation of the territory, for they remain protected persons.\n\nJustification of self-defence and military necessity\n\nThe principle of self-defence cannot be employed as a justification for the construction of the separation Wall. It is established international law that the right to self-defence is a temporary right. In the present case however, the permanent structure of the separation Wall suggests the opposite. The principles of necessity and proportionality, which form part of the doctrine of self-defence, enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter, have been violated by Israel through the construction and the severe consequences of the separation Wall. These consequences have been the unwarranted restrictions of movement, isolation of civilians from their farmlands, destruction of crops and impairment of access to essential social services as described in the report of the Secretary-General prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolution ES-10/13 (A/ES-10/248 dated 3 December 2003) which is before the Court. These consequences are totally disproportionate and unnecessary, bearing in mind that the focus of Israeli defence is occasional and irregular attacks by lone operators.\n\nA question of fact that begs the Courts consideration is why, if the separation Wall as a measure of self-defence is intended to protect Israeli citizens and territory, it is not being constructed on undisputed Israeli territory? Is the logical explanation for the chosen route of the separation Wall cutting across occupied territory not an attempt of de facto annexation? The answer in our view is obvious and in the affirmative.\n\nThe justification that has consistently been advanced by the Israeli Government for the construction of the separation Wall, is that it is necessary to ensure the security of Israel. They maintain that the destruction and seizure of Palestinian property and the violation of human rights of the Palestinian population are demanded by the necessities of war, as permitted by Article 23 of the Hague Regulations of 1907. In this regard the Court should take note that the Israeli Government in this instance is relying for protection on the very same Hague Regulations that they have always maintained do not bind them. Nonetheless, it is submitted that the concept of “military necessity” does not release a State from the obligations of complying with international humanitarian law. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols, together with the Hague Regulations, have already struck the balance between the demands made on the law of conduct of war and the requirements of humanity.\n\nThe right of Israel to security has never been denied, but this right must be exercised within recognized norms of international law."

      "texto": "The application of the principles of the United Nations Charter, the resolutions of United Nations Security Council and United Nations General Assembly, for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on the termination of the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and the self-determination of the people of Palestine.\n\nWe would like to submit that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is based on the fundamental principle of the United Nations Charter and general international law that forcible occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and attempted annexation of territory through use of force is also illegal. This principle underlines the relevant Untied Nations Security Council resolutions including resolutions 242, 338, 1397 and 1402. It also informs the peace process, and the recommendations of the Mitchell Report, the Tenet Work Plan and the Road Map endorsed by the Quartet. This fundamental principle requires the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories and the declaration of Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace and calls for the complete cessation of settlement activities. The construction of the Wall operates to frustrate and undermine the application of this fundamental principle and represents a move to annex and permanently occupy the territory of Palestine and alter the ground realities to the detriment of the people of Palestine. A series of United Nations General Assembly resolutions have reaffirmed the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination including their right to have an independent State of their own while recognizing that all States in the region have the right to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. The ongoing construction of the Wall effectively denies the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination. The construction also negates the inalienable right to return of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe application of international humanitarian law and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 prohibits the occupying power from depriving protected persons from the benefit of the Convention in any case or in any manner whatsoever including annexation of the whole or part of the occupied territory (Art. 47). This provision has been described as having “an absolute character”. The provision also incorporates a universally recognized rule endorsed by jurists and confirmed by numerous rulings of national and international courts, namely, “As long as hostilities continue the Occupying Power cannot therefore annex the occupied territory, even if it occupies the whole of the territory concerned. A decision on the point can only be reached in the peace treaty.” The construction of the Wall violates and breaches this basic rule, which has been declared applicable to the Occupied Territory of Palestine by resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly. The construction of the Wall also breaches Articles 9, 39, 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It effectively deprives the Palestinian people from enjoyment of their property, access to employment and means of livelihood, access to natural resources necessary for human survival.\nFor these reasons it is our submission that the construction of the Wall constitutes a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n\nThe four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 enjoy universal acceptance and have passed into customary international law. These instruments constitute the central pillars of international humanitarian law. In the hierarchy of norms, the Geneva Conventions enjoy precedence. The Israeli claim that the Wall constructed in the Occupied Palestine Territory as a security barrier is not tenable. The location of the Wall itself raises grave questions of legality and the actual motive behind the construction of the Wall in the Occupied Territories. As was made amply clear in the Palestinian presentation this morning, the security needs could very well have been addressed by Israel without fundamentally altering the character of the Occupied Territories and segmenting it into small parcels with the presence of Israeli settlements. Bangladesh respectfully submits that the International Court of Justice reaffirms the sanctity of the Geneva Conventions and their application to the situation now obtaining in Palestine. It is necessary that this be so for the maintenance of international peace and security and that an affirmation of fundamental points of law is essential to uphold the rule of law amongst nations. The International Court of Justice, we hope, will adjudge and declare the construction of the Wall as illegal and contrary to general international law. We also hope that the esteemed Court will spell out in clear terms the legal consequences of the construction of this Wall.\n\nThe legal consequences of the construction of the Wall\n\nThe construction of the Wall in Palestine territory by the Occupying Power represents the culmination of a long-standing policy of permanent occupation and annexation of territory. The construction engenders crimes against humanity and in particular the following:; Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking a direct part in hostilities,; Intentionally directing attacks against civilian objects, that is, objects which are not military objectives,; Intentionally directing attacks against personnel, installations, materials, units or vehicles involved in a humanitarian assistance or peace-keeping mission in accordance with the United Nations Charter, as long as they are entitled to the protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflicts,; The transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the Occupied Territory within or outside this Territory,; Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not military objectives,; Destroying or seizing the enemys property unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war,; Declaring abolished, suspended or inadmissible in a court of law the rights and actions of the nationals of the hostile party,; Committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment,; Intentionally directing attacks against building, materials, medical units and transport and personnel using the distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions in conformity with international law; Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including wilfully impeding relief supplies as provided for under the Geneva Convention.\n\nBangladesh submits that the impact of the construction of the Wall in and at the vicinity of Jerusalem also deserves special consideration by the International Court of Justice, as it alters or purports to alter the special status of the Holy City sacred to three great faiths. Bangladesh believes that the solution of the problem of Jerusalem and abandoning the construction of the Wall in the vicinity of the Holy City is a key to the achievement of just and durable peace in the Middle East."

      "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
      "texto": "On the competence of the Court\n\nOn the competence of the Court, Article 92 of the United Nations Charter designated the Court as the “principal judicial organ of the United Nations”, and Article 96, paragraph 1, stipulates that the General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question. The Statute of the Court (Article 65) further stipulates that the Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request. There are no limitations, provisos or restrictions in those Articles, once the organs are requesting opinions on a question of law.\n\n6. The General Assembly, as authorized by the United Nations Charter has made such a request to the Court via its resolution ES-10/14 adopted on 8 December 2003 to urgently render an advisory opinion on the question of:\n\n “What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the Occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?”\n\nThis request has come from a duly authorized organ (the United Nations General Assembly) as stipulated by the United Nations Charter and the Statute, and on a question of law (the legal consequences of the construction of the Wall within the rules and principles of international law). Arguments to the contrary do not hold, as the Court itself has proved through time. In its Advisory Opinions of 28 May 1948 and 3 March 1950 on Admission of States to the United Nations, the Court declared that it could give an opinion on any legal question and that there was no provision which prohibited it from exercising “an interpretive function falling within the normal exercise of its judicial powers”.\n\nThe Court further pointed out in its Opinion of 3 March 1950 that it could not attribute a political character to a request “which, framed in abstract terms, invited it to undertake an essentially judicial task, the interpretation of a treaty provision”. It is also a known fact that the majority of international law issues are typically part of a wider political context.\n\nIn its Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia of 21 June 1971, the President of the Court declared on the question of political pressure, and as a matter of judicial propriety, that the Court as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, and in that capacity “would act only on the basis of law, independently of all outside influences or interventions whatsoever”.\n\nThe competence of the Court was again emphasized on considering the Western Sahara Advisory Opinion request in October 1975. The Court stated that “under Article 65, paragraph 1, of the Statute, the Court may give an advisory opinion, on any legal question at the request of any duly authorized body. The Court notes that the General Assembly of the United Nations is suitably authorized by Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter and that the two questions submitted to it are framed in terms of law and raise problems of international law. They are in principle questions of a legal character, even if they also embody questions of fact, and even if they do not call upon the Court to pronounce on existing rights and obligations. The Court is accordingly competent to entertain the request.”\n\nThe Court also, in the WHO and Egypt Advisory Opinion of 20 December 1980, stated that “it does not have to deal with the motives, which may have inspired the request once a submitted request falls within the normal exercise of its judicial process”. The Court affirmed this position further in the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion of 6 July 1996.\n\nThe Court thus has consistently taken the position, that as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, it has to shoulder its judicial interpretive responsibilities, and only decline giving opinions when there are compelling reasons, and when the question is not of law. As a matter of fact this Court has never failed to assert its competence to give advisory opinions on cases referred to it by duly authorized organs of the United Nations, and which has competence to do so on the specified issue. In this respect the Court summarized its practice in granting advisory opinions in the case concerning the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1996, when it stated: “In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court, only ‘compelling reasons could lead it to such a refusal... there has been no refusal, based on the discretionary power of the Court, to act upon a request for advisory opinion in the history of the present Court.”\n\n "

      "texto": "The continuous construction and the presence of the Wall along the route which it follows defy the will of the international community. The Secretary-Generals report clearly states that Israel has not complied with the demand of the United Nations General Assembly in its resolution ES-10/13 to stop or reverse the ongoing construction of the barrier. The reports observations included the following: “In keeping with the request of the General Assembly in resolution ES-10/13, I have concluded that Israel is not in compliance with the Assemblys demand that it ‘stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.”\n\nIn his recent statement to the Court of 19 January 2004, the Secretary-General further concludes that the update of the report “finds that the Government of Israel has continued with ongoing construction of the barrier along the route approved by the Israeli cabinet on 1 October 2003 in Decision 883”.\n\n16. The Wall built in Occupied Palestinian Territory complicates efforts for reaching a final settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli problem, which has remained a highly threatening issue for international peace and security. As the United Nations Secretary-General concluded in his report prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolution ES-10/13, the Wall is of serious concern and has implications for the future. As he put it,\n\n“In the midst of the roadmap process, when each party should be making good-faith confidence-building gestures, the Barriers construction in the West Bank cannot in this regard, be seen as anything but a deeply counterproductive act. The placing of most of the structure on Occupied Palestinian Land could impair further negotiations.”\n\nThe Wall, hence, is a contradiction to international law being built in the Occupied Territory and can only be seen as intended to prejudge and complicate the final solution. The Secretary-Generals report further concludes “the Wall could change the longer-term prospects for peace by making the creation of an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian State more difficult, or that increases suffering among the Palestinian People”.\n\nIt is therefore our contention that an advisory opinion pronouncing the legal consequences of the construction of the Wall shall benefit the prospects for peace by clarifying the law and discouraging unilateral negative actions.\n\nIt is a breach of international obligations by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is requested of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character: this is found in Article 12 of the Draft Law on State Responsibility adopted by the International Law Commission in 2001 and of which the United Nations General Assembly took note in resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001.\n\nThe construction of the Wall is to be considered an internationally wrongful act, as it constitutes a breach of international law within the meaning of these Articles.\n\nIt follows that Israel should continue the duty to perform the obligation breached including termination and cessation of the wrongful act, restitution and reparation.\n\nFurthermore, the construction of the Wall and its planned route, which deviates from the Armistice Line, and consumes almost 16.6 per cent of the entire West Bank, as reported by the United Nations Secretary-General, clearly violates the status of Palestine and infringes on the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. It also violates a fundamental principle of international law that is the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. The Court, as the guardian of international law, has the duty to give guidance when international law is violated: as the Court has stressed in its Advisory Opinion on the South Africa in Namibia case of June 1971, on the question of legal consequences, “an illegal situation can not remain without consequences”. The construction of the Wall by Israel entails undesirable consequences if left unchecked.\n\nMr. President, honourable Members of the Court, in conclusion, the Government of the Sudan is of the opinion that:\n\nthe Court is competent and has jurisdiction to grant an advisory opinion on the legal question submitted to it by the United Nations General Assembly, and that there are no compelling reasons preventing it from doing so; and that the construction of the Wall by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is in contradiction of international law, and that it should comply with the United Nations General Assemblys resolution ES-10/13 of 21 October 2003 to stop and reverse the construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory including in and around East Jerusalem. It should also be obliged to make adequate reparations for the damages caused by the construction action."

      "texto": "On the applicability of international law on the Israeli action Mr. President, honourable Members of the Court, once the Court ascertains its competence in dealing with the request, then we believe the question of the legal consequences of the construction of the Wall within international law entails the consideration of a number of issues. Our contribution will focus on a limited number of these issues.\n\nThe question of the occupation of Israel of Palestinian and other Arab territories is beyond contention. This is ascertained in relevant United Nations Security Council and United Nations General Assembly resolutions. For example United Nations Security Council resolution 242 of 1967, referred to “territories occupied in the recent conflict”. The Occupied Palestinian Territories terminology has been used in numerous resolutions including the recent United Nations General Assembly resolutions of which ES-10/14 requested the urgent advisory opinion from this Court. The International Committee of the Red Cross in a statement before the conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, convened in Geneva on 5 December 2001, stated that it has always “affirmed the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the State of Israel, including East Jerusalem”. The International Committee of the Red Cross further stated:\n\n“the Convention, ratified by Israel in 1951 remains fully applicable and relevant in the current context of violence. As an occupying power, Israel is also bound by other customary rules relating to occupation expressed in the regulations annexed to the Hague Convention respecting the laws and customs of war of 18th October 1907.” The High Contracting Parties have twice affirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the Occupied Palestinian Territory on 15 July 1999, and on 5 December 2001 in the Geneva special sessions, respectively. United Nations resolution A/58/155 of 15 July 2003 has affirmed the same.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories Occupied by Israel  and this is its title  since 1967, report A/57/366 dated 29 August 2002, quoted the United Nations Secretary-General, speaking to the Security Council on 12 March 2002, as calling upon Israel to end its “illegal occupation” of the Palestinian Territory.\n\nAsked why he used the term “illegal”, he replied that the Security Council and the General Assembly have both on various occasions declared aspects of Israeli occupation as illegal. The comments of the Secretary-General  stated the Special Rapporteur  “underscore the fact that it is by the law of occupation that Israels conduct must be judged and that many of its practices violate basic principles of that governing law”.\n\nThe applicability of the Convention and other customary rules of international humanitarian law oblige the occupying power to refrain from certain acts that are in violation of them. Common Article I of the Convention obliges the High Contracting Parties to undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances. The construction of the Wall, as stated in resolution ES-10/13, which demanded that Israel stop and reverse its construction; this construction is in contradiction to the relevant provisions of international law. Also, the construction of the Wall and the whole régime of measures relating to the Wall entails confiscation of lands, serious hardship to the occupied population, including displacement, other demographic effects and undue restriction of movement and mobility, as enumerated in the United Nations Secretary-Generals report ES-10/248 of 24 November 2003 pursuant to United Nations General Assembly resolution ES-10/13, and in addition to prejudice to territorial status, all being in violation of international law.\n\nThe Wall also violates international human rights law. It places undue suffering on the occupied Palestinian population and infringes on their basic human rights as stipulated in the two human rights covenants and other relevant instruments, which are blinding on Israel. The Secretary-Generals report clearly establishes this fact. The Court can rely on the Secretary-Generals fact analysis in giving its opinion, as the text of the Assemblys request makes clear. The Wall will affect the lives of some 17,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and 220,000 in East Jerusalem. As the Secretary-General put it, “Palestinians will live in enclaves, areas where the Barrier almost completely encircles communities and tracts of land. The planned route incorporates nearly 320,000 settlers, including approximately 178,000 in Occupied East Jerusalem.”\n\nThe humanitarian and socio-economic impact was further illuminated by the Secretary-Generals report. “Recent reports by the World Bank and the United Nations show that construction has dramatically increased such damage in communities along its route, primarily through the loss, or severely limited access to land, jobs, and markets.”\n\nThe Wall, as the report informs, restricts movement of the population, isolated towns, affected health services, curtailed agricultural output and increased food insecurity in the region, all in violation of human rights law."

      "texto": "The Court should render the requested opinion as there are no compelling reasons for the Court to refuse the request.\n\nLet me analyse some of the objections put forward against the propriety of the Court rendering the opinion.\n\nThe argument of “a pending dispute” or “circumvention”\n\nIt has been claimed by Israel, and a few other States, that the request concerns a contentious matter in respect of which Israel has not given its consent to the jurisdiction of the Court, and that it was, therefore, improper for the Court to render the requested opinion. Otherwise, the principle that a State is not obliged to allow disputes to be submitted to the Court without its consent would be circumvented.\n\nSuch consideration of propriety, however, could only apply where the essential content of a dispute was a mere bilateral matter between two States arising independently of the United Nations. But, is the problem which the Court is requested to address a dispute of an essentially bilateral character?\n\nNo it is not. The issue put before the Court has to be determined in light of the terms of the question put to it. The question relates to an enlightenment of the General Assembly on the legal consequences of a specific circumstance: the construction of the Wall.\n\nIsrael could not, validly, object to the General Assemblys exercise of its powers to deal with, and to seek an opinion on, the violations of fundamental principles of the Charter, including the right to self-determination, the violations of international humanitarian law, where there is an obligation on all parties to the Geneva Conventions “to respect and to ensure respect” of their provisions, and the violations of fundamental human rights law, all of which constitute erga omnes obligations “owed to the international community as a whole”\n\nIn addition, many of the norms\n\nviolated by Israel constitute peremptory norms of international law: ius cogens. Thus, other States not only Palestine may “take lawful measures” against Israel “to ensure the cessation of the breach and reparation in the interest of the injured State or of the beneficiaries of the obligation breached”3 I am quoting the ILC Draft  in this case the “interest” of Palestine and the Palestinians affected by the Wall.\n\nClearly, there is in this case a controversy, but one which has its fons et origo in a larger one, which arose within the ranks of the League of Nations and was later inherited by the United Nations, and today remains in its custody. It is a controversy over matters in which the General Assembly is directly involved. There are so many United Nations resolutions on Israels illegal occupation of the territories in which the Wall is being constructed. The controversy did not arise independently in bilateral relations.\n\nThe object of the request is to obtain from the Court an opinion which the General Assembly deems of assistance for the proper exercise of its functions concerning Palestine. The legal questions involved in the request are located in a broader frame of reference than the settlement of a particular bilateral dispute. They embrace a broad range of questions relating to the functioning of the United Nations and the legal order in general.\n\nWhy should it be “improper” for the Court to address these questions?\n\nThe alleged “absence of an essential factual context”\n\nBy pretending that it was not going to address the substance while it has indeed Israel is trying to mislead the Court into a decision not to answer the request because it has not before it the factual and legal issues essential to any proper assessment of the substance of the request, to which it alone, it boasts, can contribute. And, accordingly, it is alleged, the Court would have to base its pronouncement on facts which are not well established, and, thus, on “speculation”.\n\nThis is in itself a very speculative argument. It is part of the judicial function to deal with situations where the facts are controversial. It is part of the judicial function to determine what facts are relevant for a certain conclusion on the legal situation, in this case: whether the Wall is in violation of certain rules of international law or whether its construction can be justified.\n\nActually, the Court is already in possession of sufficient information and evidence furnished by independent sources, including the United Nations, its organs, Rapporteurs and other international organizations, as well as by States. It does not need such information from Israel alone. Yet, Israel too has furnished extensive information and evidence through its official declarations and through its Written Statement, together with its annexes, of which the Court will undoubtedly avail itself. Israel cannot now complain that the Court does not have facts that it would have, otherwise, furnished. It was invited to do so but chose not to furnish more. A State which declines to give certain information to the Court is certainly precluded from raising an alleged lack of information of the Court as a basis for challenging the propriety of the Court pronouncing itself on the issue.\n\nYet, there is no real uncertainty concerning the facts. Probably, the only disagreement is over the issue of when and for how long the gates of the Wall are open!\n\nDoes the uncertainty about the facts make it “improper” for the Court to render the requested opinion?\n\nThe alleged violation of procedural justice\n\nIsrael claims that the way in which the question is asked violates principles of procedural justice, it argues, the question arbitrarily selects only one specific aspect of the problem and neglects all others. Thus, a fundamental issue of procedural justice arises, Israel argues. One could simply respond that it is up to the General Assembly to choose the question on which it wants to have the advice of the Court, and that it is not for the Court to second-guess this wish. The entire argument, however, is a gross distortion of the true situation. Israels main concern, the alleged security threat, is clearly put before the Court. Israel has had ample opportunities to argue this before the Court, and it has, for all practical purposes, done so in its Written Statement. It might have been helpful if Israel had put more concrete arguments before the Court. But Israel certainly cannot claim that it was not granted procedural equality.\n\nThe requirements of procedural justice cannot make it improper for the Court to render this opinion.\n\nThe alleged absence of a useful purpose\n\nIt has been argued, wrongly relying on certain dicta of the Court, that it should not answer the question because that answer could not serve any useful purpose. The authors of this argument seem to think that in the light of the determinations which competent organs of the United Nations have already made, a determination by the Court could not have any added value.\n\nThe General Assembly has indeed made a determination as to the illegality of the Wall, and has also declared one essential consequence of this illegality, namely that the construction should cease and that the parts of the Wall already built must be demolished. Yet, also in this respect, it is up to the General Assembly to choose the issue where it wants further guidance by the Court. But beyond this formal argument: it will, inter alia, be useful for the General Assembly to have its declarations confirmed by the Court, in particular as the views expressed by the General Assembly and by other United Nations bodies are contested by Israel; to gain clarity on a number of grounds of illegality; to gain clarity on a number of legal consequences which have not been comprehensively addressed by the General Assembly.\n\nIt is of course not for the Court to instruct the General Assembly as to what further action it should take in the light of the Courts pronouncement. The General Assembly will certainly remain seised with the issue of Palestine. Its role has been that of formulating principles and goals which govern or should govern the international community and of promoting political processes to further these goals. This role will certainly be inspired by the pronouncement of the Court. And if further measures of implementation are needed, the General Assembly could also address a recommendation to the Security Council and it will then be appropriate for the Council to take as a basis for its decision the legal situation as clarified by the Court."

      "texto": "Concluding remarks: the responsibility of the Court in the present proceedings.\n\nThe Arab League would thus like to conclude by expressing its confidence that the Court will fulfil the singular responsibility imposed upon it by exercising its role as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. This reference in Article 96 of the Charter is loaded with meaning. The Court an organ of the United Nations this means that it is an integral part of the United Nations system and hence one element of the system of maintenance of international peace and security established by the Charter. And as such its case law has participated in the reduction of world tensions. The Charters purposes and principles have come to reflect the global values of the international community and it is widely accepted today that, in addition to aggression, violations of core human rights, including the right to self-determination, as well as grave breaches of international humanitarian law, constitute the main threats to international peace and security.\n\nAs an organ of the United Nations, the Court has as its lodestar the purposes and principles for which the Organization exists these purposes and principles underlie the question of Palestine: self-determination, prohibition of the use of force, human rights and humanitarian law in its broadest sense. There is now an unprecedented unanimity on the part of the Members of the United Nations, its principal and subsidiary organs and its Specialized Agencies, that the construction of the Wall violates these purposes and principles. The Court has in the past always worked in the same direction as the other organs of the United Nations in upholding these purposes and principles. It has also promoted the work of the Organization against restrictive assertions of sovereignty by Member States. It has confirmed the normative activity of the United Nations organs, in particular the General Assembly, by upholding the fundamental role of its resolutions in the customary law process (Namibia, Nicaragua, East Timor cases), its general responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security (Expenses case), and its primary responsibility towards mandates, trust and non-self-governing territories (Namibia, Western Sahara, East Timor). The Court a judicial organ of the United Nations this has led the Court to underline the complementarity of its judicial function with the functions of the political organs of the United Nations, insisting on the “functional parallelism” which exists between it and the General Assembly and the Security Council. It has rejected the view that there are intrinsically legal questions, on the one hand, and, on the other, intrinsically political questions which are not amenable to legal and judicial scrutiny.\n\nThe Court a principal organ of the United Nations this means today that it is the court of the world community and hence the legal guardian of community values and interests. The Court has been aware of this mission. On a number of occasions it has juxtaposed the traditional bilateralist structure of international law with the notion of “collective” interest. The Court has made reference to the concept of international community which it has seen as personified in the United Nations. The Court has affirmed not only that every State has a legal interest in the respect of obligations owed to itself individually, but that each State had a duty to react to certain situations of objective illegality Namibia Opinion.\n\nPalestine, as a former Mandate, is the beneficiary of the sacred trust of civilization the main purpose of the Mandate system. This means today that the world community has a responsibility for the attainment of the right to self-determination by the Palestinian people, including the two-State solution and in the protection of its territorial integrity, that is the whole territory under occupation. As a court of the world community, the Court has its role to play in the attainment of these objectives. It now has the opportunity to pronounce on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall. To warn, as some States have done, that a pronouncement of the Court would be unhelpful or hinder negotiations, is a far-fetched presumption which has nothing to do with reality. What is very real, however, is the prospect that the silence of the Court would have dire consequences for the future emergence of Palestine as a viable and fully sovereign State. The Court, thus, must not abdicate its judicial function in the face of this Palestinian tragedy. Ultimately, it was the breakthrough pronouncements in the Namibia case, not the silence of the Court in the contentious South West Africa case, that contributed to the exercise of self-determination and full independence of that other Mandate inherited by the United Nations from its predecessor."

      "pregunta": "The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "Fundamental rules and principles of the Charter\n\nFundamental principles of the Charter: the essential point is that the construction of the Wall fundamentally affects the demographic structure of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It leads to a fragmentation of the Palestinian space, which has rightly been called Bantustanization. It makes Palestinian life burdensome, even impossible, and forces Palestinians to leave their homes, while fostering the position of the unlawful Israeli settlements. Israel denies this effect by calling the “fence” a temporary security measure. But this claim veils the true situation. It is public notice that major parts of the Wall are built in a very solid way, concrete structures, ditches, and so on. In todays newspaper you can read the latest statement of Prime Minister Sharon: “We will build the security fence and complete it.” That does not sound temporary. The Wall will incite Palestinians to move out of the encircled places, in particular in what is called the “Seam Area”, and Israelis to stay in or to come to the settlements fortified by the Wall. That is why the Wall profoundly affects the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which includes the right to remain in the place where the people has lived since many centuries, that is why it constitutes a change in status, a de facto annexation which is contrary to the prohibition of acquiring territory by force.\n\n One thing should be made crystal clear: Palestine is not a kind of no-mans land subject to appropriation by Israel. It is a self-determination unit in the borders drawn by the armistice lines of 1949. This has been recognized by the Security Council and the General Assembly in binding determinations and by Israel itself. This is the lex lata, whatever the parties may freely agree upon in the future.\n\n But does the alleged security threat not justify these measures? Is the inherent right of self-defence not recognized by the Charter? Self-defence is an act necessary to protect a State against an armed attack. As such, it is by necessity a temporary measure. A lasting change in status cannot conceivably be necessary for such protection. This is why the prohibition of acquisition of territory through the use of force, confirmed by Security Council resolution 242 and formulated in the well-known Friendly Relations Declaration of 1970, does not provide for an exception in the case of self-defence. A de facto change of status does not provide any additional security. The Wall cannot be justified as self-defence.\n\nInternational humanitarian law\n\nIts application cannot be denied. This has again been made clear by all the States which have addressed the issue in their written statements, including France, Ireland and Switzerland, guardian of the Geneva Conventions, and it has been convincingly pleaded the course of the present oral hearings. The essential point is the duty of an occupying power not to destroy private property and to provide for a decent existence of the civilian population, an obligation which is violated in many respects.\n\nBut does the security threat not justify these measures? The right of a party to a conflict to take measures for the protection of its own population living on its territory is certainly recognized. But, as the ICRC has clearly put it in a recent declaration which deserves to be re-emphasized, although it has already been quoted to the Court:\n\n“[T]he West Bank Barrier, in as far as its route deviates from the ‘Green Line into occupied territory, is contrary to international humanitarian law. The problems affecting the Palestinian population in their daily lives clearly demonstrate that it runs counter to Israels obligation under international humanitarian law to ensure the humane treatment and well-being of the civilian population living under its occupation. The measures taken by the Israeli authorities linked to the construction of the Barrier in occupied territory go far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power under international humanitarian law.”\n\nHuman rights\n\nThe applicability of international human rights treaties as well as the corresponding rules of customary international law has once again been affirmed in the present proceedings. This was clearly stated by a number of States, including France, Ireland and Switzerland. The latter drew your attention to the fact that you held, in the Nuclear Weapons case, that a concurrent application of international human rights and international humanitarian law was indeed required. International human rights guarantees are violated in a number of respects which we have developed in our Written Statement. In addition to the rights related to the unbearable deterioration of the living conditions of the Palestinian population, one further aspect of these violations has to be stressed: freedom of religion of Christians and Muslims, as the Wall also bars access to the Holy Places of these religions.\n\nBut does the alleged security threat not justify these measures? The extent to which security considerations may serve as a reason for limiting human rights is determined by the limitation clauses associated with a number of guarantees. They are summarized under the heading of proportionality.\n\nThis means the measure must serve a legitimate purpose. The security of the population is such legitimate purpose, but the protection of the Israeli settlements is not. These settlements, as has been repeatedly explained before you, are themselves a violation of international law. A situation created by a violation of international law cannot serve as a legitimate purpose for limiting human rights: “Ex iniuria ius non oritur”.\n\nA second condition: the measure must be necessary for achieving its purpose. But, as even Israel admits in its Written Statement, the security situation has not changed since the construction of the Wall. The attacks complained of by Israel have not diminished. It was very convincingly pleaded yesterday: the security to be provided by the Wall is just an illusion. A measure which is incapable of achieving its objective is a useless, and therefore unjustifiable infringement on human rights. Therefore, it has to be stressed that the true purpose of the Wall is different (and not legitimate): it is a means to change the legal status quo of the occupied territory.\nFinally, the limitation of a human right must not be excessive in relation to the advantage it is designed to achieve. Making the life of an entire population unbearable is an infringement of human rights grossly disproportionate to the real scope of the threat perceived by Israel. Thus, the security argument fails in respect of any limitation of human rights which are imposed on the Palestinians by reason of the construction of the Wall.\n\nTo sum up, Mr. President, Members of the Court: the Wall does not stand between terrorists and potential victims. It stands between the farmer and his land, between the employee and the employer, between the merchant and the client, between the child and its school, between the patient and the doctor, between families who want to unite, between the faithful and his or her Holy Places. As a matter of international law, it does not belong there at all!"

      "texto": "The Court should clearly state the consequences which these violations of applicable international law entail for various actors.\n\nMr. President, Members of the Court, in the Namibia Opinion, you held and this was already quoted by the preceding speaker that “a binding determination made by a competent organ of the United Nations to the effect that a situation is illegal cannot remain without consequence”\n\nConsequences for Israel: under the law of State responsibility, there is, first, a duty to cease the unlawful act. The construction must be stopped immediately. Secondly, there is a duty of reparation in the form of restitution: the Wall must be demolished, land taken from Palestinian owners for the purpose of constructing the Wall must be given back, regulatory instruments related to the construction of the Wall are null and void and must be rescinded. Damages going beyond the loss of land, which has to be given back, must be compensated. In addition, appropriate assurances of non-repetition have to be given.\n\nConsequences for third States: the rules which have been violated constitute erga omnes obligations. Other States are thus entitled to take appropriate measures to ensure that the breach ceases and that reparation is provided. As to the Fourth Geneva Convention, it provides that all States parties are obliged to respect and ensure respect of its provisions. Thus, violations trigger the right and duty of all States parties to take measures to ensure compliance with this treaty. In addition, the ICRC has a responsibility in this respect, and it has fulfilled the duty in an exemplary fashion.\n\nFurthermore, these breaches constitute violations of peremptory norms of international law, of ius cogens. This entails additional duties to take measures to redress the situation.\n\nAnd one aspect must be emphasized which is of particular importance for any future settlement: no State may recognize the de facto situation unlawfully brought about by the construction of the Wall.\n\nFinally, consequences as to personal criminal liability: in various respects, the construction of the Wall constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. All States are, thus, obliged to prosecute offenders which happen to find themselves in their power, or to extradite them to a State willing to prosecute them.\n\nConsequences for the United Nations and the Specialized Agencies: The General Assembly is a guardian of the Palestinian right to self-determination. The Security Council has addressed the situation according to its primary responsibility for the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security. In the exercise of these responsibilities, both organs will have to pay due respect to the determination made by the Court. They are under a duty not only to continue, but also to reinforce their efforts to achieve a lasting and peaceful solution for the question of Palestine based on the rule of law. It is the duty of all Members of the United Nations system to assist, within their respective fields of competence, the work of these political organs. The League of Arab States respectfully asks the Court to clearly declare these consequences in its opinion. This would not only be for the benefit of the General Assembly which has requested this opinion, but for the benefit of the international community at large. By clearly stating the law as it is, the Court will contribute to a peace process based on the rule of law."

      "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
      "texto": "In  relation  to  substantive  issues  raised  by  that  question  the  various  Written  Statements reveal no significant disagreement.  Jordan feels no need to comment on these issues, and stands by what it said in its Written Statement58.  But the Courts jurisdiction and its discretionary powers in relation  to  advisory  opinions  have  proved  more  contentious.    Jordan  has  set  out  in  its  Written Statement arguments to show that the Court has jurisdiction to give the requested advisory opinion, and  that  there  are  no  compelling  reasons  for  the  Court  to  decline  to  exercise  that  jurisdiction. While  maintaining  those  arguments,  I  should  just  like  to  add  some  comments  in  response  to arguments to the contrary which have been put forward. /n/n The  starting  point,  Mr. President,  has  to  be  that  (and  here  I  quote  from  the  relevant General  Assembly  resolution)59  “the  United  Nations  has  a  permanent  responsibility  towards  the question  of  Palestine  until  the  question  is  resolved  in  all  its  aspects  in  a  satisfactory  manner  in accordance  with international legitimacy”.  The General Assembly, as one of the principal organs of the United Nations, shares (as does the Court, also one of the principal organs) that “permanent responsibility” for the question of Palestine.  In exercising that responsibility the Assembly is faced with a fact  the construction of the Wall.  It has to know what this implies for its future actions. It has therefore asked the Court, as the Organizations principal judicial organ, to give an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of that fact.  Nothing could be more natural. /n/nYet  it  has  been  urged  that  the  Court,  notwithstanding  its  responsibilities  as  the  United Nations principal judicial organ, should leave the General Assembly without the advice it needs.  In Jordans  submission,  Mr. President  and  Members  of  the  Court,  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  Jordans Written  Statement60  that  cannot  be  the  right  course  for  this  Court  to  take.    The  Court  has  never before exercised its discretion so as to decline to give an advisory opinion properly requested by an authorized organ;  and there is no cause for it to do so now. /n/nThe Courts view of the matter has been remarkably consistent since its pronouncements in  that  case.    In  the  Namibia  case  the  Court  referred  to  a  request  being  “put  forward  by  a  United Nations organ with reference to its own decisions and it seeks legal advice from the Court on the consequences  and  implications  of  these  decisions”64;    in  the  Western  Sahara  case  the  Court  said that “an opinion given by the Court in the present proceedings will furnish the General Assembly with elements of a legal character relevant to its further treatment of the decolonization of Western Sahara”65.  Mutatis mutandis, Mr. President, that is exactly the situation in the present case. /n/nMr. President,  seeking  an  advisory  opinion  in  no  way  interferes  with  the  Councils primary  responsibilities    especially  when  on  the  matter  in  hand  the  Council  was  unable  to  act because of the negative vote of a Permanent Member.  But in any event, the argument cannot stand. It  is  startling  in  its  implications,  and  without  foundation  in  the  Charter.    If  accepted  it  would  cast serious doubt on the legality of much that the General Assembly has done over the past 37 years in relation to the Occupied Territories.  The Council and the Assembly have overlapping competences,  within  the  limits  of  Article 12  of  the  Charter.    But  that  Article  only  precludes  the Assembly from making a recommendation with regard to a dispute or situation while the Council is exercising its functions in respect of a dispute or situation:  and in this case the Assembly made no recommendation, only a request to another organ of the United Nations for an advisory opinion in the exercise of its specific powers under Article 96 of the Charter. /n/nIn  the  present  case  the  non-consenting  State    Israel    is  a  Member  of  the  United Nations,  and  a  party  to  the  Statute  of  the  Court,  and  has  thus  agreed  to  the  Courts  advisory procedures.    Moreover,  Israel  has  actively  participated  in  these  proceedings,  both  as  regards  the composition of the Court and by submitting a written statement. /n/nIt  is  suggested,  Mr. President,  that  since  the  General  Assembly  has  already  determined that  the  building  of  the  Wall  is  illegal,  there  is  consequently  no  value  in  the  Court  giving  its advisory opinion on the same matter.  But, Mr. President, a determination by the General Assembly that  a  particular  state  of  affairs  is  illegal  is,  while  indicative  of  an  opinio  juris  on  the  part  of  the international  community80,  it  is  nevertheless  a  determination  by  a  political  organ  of  the  United Nations:  the confirmation, if so it be, of that determination by the United Nations principal judicial organ  does  add  something  of  legal  value  to  what  the  General  Assembly  has  already  said.    The argument  in  any  event  misrepresents  the  question  on  which  the  General  Assembly  has  asked  the Court for its opinion.  The General Assemblys question is not whether the Wall is illegal, but asks about  the  legal  consequences  of  constructing  the  Wall.    Those  consequences  go  much  wider  than any finding of illegality.  It is the wider consequences, not yet addressed by the General Assembly, upon which the General Assembly seeks the Courts guidance.  Finally  and this is perhaps the overriding consideration  the General Assembly has asked for an advisory opinion on a matter on which it believes it will be assisted by having the Courts views before it:  the Court is, indeed, well placed to make a constructive contribution to a difficult situation at the heart of which lie issues of international law.  As the  Court has already indicated, it is for the General Assembly, and not for the  Court,  to  determine  whether  the  General  Assembly  needs  the  advisory  opinion  which  it  has sought and what use to make of it81. /n/nThe  next  line  of  argument  to  be  considered  is  that  the  giving  of  an  advisory  opinion would be unhelpful to the broader peace process within the diplomatic framework of the Road Map because, it is said, it would make the overall negotiating process more difficult. /n/nBut that is a matter about which one can only speculate.  It must not be forgotten that the Court is called upon in these proceedings to consider only a very specific factual situation, on the legal  consequences  of  which  the  Assembly  stands  in  need  of  the  Courts  opinion.    Speculation about the political consequences which might follow for the peace process is a political matter into which the Court should not allow itself to be drawn. /n/nMoreover,  the  Court  has  already  rejected  the  argument  that  because  the  giving  of  an advisory  opinion  might  have  an  impact  on  some  current  negotiating  process  therefore  the  Court ought to refrain from giving an opinion properly requested of it.  In the Nuclear Weapons case that argument was advanced, and the Courts response was clear:  “the Court cannot regard this factor as a compelling reason to decline to exercise its jurisdiction”89."

While  this  argument  will  be addressed in greater detail by counsel for Jordan, there is, Mr. President and Members of the Court, a general point I should like to make. /n/nIn  its  Written  Statement  Israel  has  emphasized  how  many  attempts  it  has  made  to  reach  a peaceful  settlement  of  the  Palestinian  question  since  the  Israeli-Palestinian  talks  in  Oslo  in  1993. Mr. President,  Israel  has  no  monopoly  of  such  attempts.    We  all  want  a  peaceful  settlement.    My country, together with the Palestinians, has been every bit as assiduous in its peace efforts. /n/nThe  Assembly  knew  what  it  was  doing  when  it  decided  to  seek  the  Courts  opinion  on  a specific legal question, and it took that course for reasons of which it was the best  and only judge. /n/nMr.  President,  the  Assembly  needs the  opinion it  has  requested.    In  the  language  of  the Court  in  the  Reservations  case  “the  object  of  this  request  for  an  Opinion  is  to  guide  the  United Nations in respect of its own action”63.  It is precisely the Assemblys own future decisions which require  that  it  should  know  the  legal  consequences  of  the  building  of  the  Wall:    only  then  can  it properly decide what action to take. /n/nThe argument has also been made that since under the Charter the Security Council has the  primary  responsibility  for  the  maintenance  of  international  peace  and  security,  therefore  the General Assembly may not take action which interferes with the Councils exercise of its primary responsibilities  upon which, in the present context, it has been actively engaged for many years and is indeed currently engaged. /n/nThe  Assemblys  role  in  relation  to  the  maintenance  of  peace  and  security  may  be secondary,  but  it  is  not  non-existent.    It  retains  its  normal  competences  under  the  Charter,  and  its request for an advisory opinion falls fairly and squarely within them. /n/nMoreover, Mr. President, the specific question put to the Court does not directly address a legal question actually pending between two States.  The Courts advisory opinion will not settle any  existing  bilateral  dispute,  since  it  will  not  deal  with  such  a  dispute:    the  Courts  opinion  will deal  only  with  a  particular  request  relating  to  certain  legal  consequences  flowing  from  a  given situation;  it will only be “advisory”, and it will only be addressed to the General Assembly. /n/nThe fact that the question put to the Court by the Assembly may have political aspects or motivation, or that the Courts opinion may when given to the Assembly have implications in the wider  political  arena,  is,  as  the  Court  has  often  indicated,  a  separate  matter  which  does  not  affect the Courts ability to give its advisory opinion on what is clearly a legal question75.  It is significant that,  on  every  occasion  when  such  an  argument  has  been  raised,  the  Court  has  rejected  it.    In  the Nicaragua case, in 1986, the Court noted that it “has never shied away from a case brought before it  merely  because  it  had  political  implications . . .”76.    It  has  not  done  so  subsequently,  Mr. President, and Jordan submits that it should not start doing so now. /n/nNor can the Court be regarded as being in some way politicized just because it fulfils its judicial function by giving an advisory opinion on a matter with political implications:  the Court, Mr. President  and  Members  of  the  Court,  is  a  more  robust  institution  than  that  suggestion  would imply.  The issue is not the politicization of the Court, but rather emphasizing that the questions for decision are purely legal. /n/nIt  is  also  suggested  that  for  the  Court  to  respond  to  the  question  put  by  the  General Assembly would prejudice progress in the current negotiations for a Middle East peace settlement, which  are  taking  place  on  the  basis  of  the  “Road  Map”,  including  certain  issues  known  as “permanent status” issues. /n/nIt may be that much of the concern felt about the possible impact of the Courts opinion is based on a fear that the Court might range far and wide over a myriad legal issues which might be  thought  to  be  raised  by  the  question  put  to  the  Court.    But  this  is  not  so,  Mr. President.    The Court, in answering the question put to it, will no doubt keep strictly to the issues raised directly by that question.  And being an advisory opinion, the Court has the possibility of saying only as much about any particular aspect of the question put to it as it considers appropriate. /n/nThe further argument has been advanced that the question put to the Court is so complex and uncertain that it is not a legal question at all, and raises such complex issues of fact and law as to be unsuitable for determination by an advisory opinion. /n/nThe focus for the Courts opinion is also limited.  It is also clear.  The Court is asked to give  its  opinion  on  “the  legal  consequences”  of  the  construction  of  that  Wall.    There  is  nothing uncertain  about  a  question  so  phrased.    There  can  be  nothing  inappropriate  in  asking  a  judicial organ to give an opinion on the legal consequences flowing from a specific situation about which the facts are well known:  indeed questions about the legal consequences of an act are quintessentially  legal  questions  since,  in  the  words  of  the  Court  in  the  Western  Sahara  case,  they are  “framed  in  terms  of  law  and  raise  problems  of  international  law . . .  [and]  are  by  their  very nature  susceptible  of  a  reply  based  on  law;    indeed,  they  are  scarcely  susceptible  of  a  reply otherwise than on the basis of law”91."

      "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "Two  things  about  it  are  of  crucial  importance.    First,  much  of  the  Wall  now  being  built  by Israel  is  in  territory  which  does  not  belong  to  Israel,  but  which  is,  rather,  occupied  territory   territory which, as consistently acknowledged by the international community for over 35 years, is subject to a special régime in international law. /n/nIt  is  the  fact  that  the  Wall  is  being  built  on  Occupied  Territory  which  is  at  the  heart  of  the present  case.    If  Israel  has  a  security  problem,  then  in  principle  Israel  can  protect  itself  by  taking suitable measures within its own territory.  If the Wall had been constructed wholly within Israels sovereign territory, these proceedings would not have come about. /n/nThe second crucial factor about the Wall is that it is a wall with the characteristics described in  the  Secretary-Generals  report.    On  the  screen  now  (and  at  tab 1  in  the  judges  folders)  is  a succession of photographs taken of the Wall.  The Court can see that in physical terms the Wall is not  just  a  simple  fence.    It  dominates  its  surroundings,  separates  homes  from  their  lands,  people from  their  places  of  worship  as  well  as  from  essential  services  and  sources  of  water,  it  divides communities, and cuts a swathe through towns and villages. /n/nThose  physical  characteristics  are  supplemented  by  an  extensive  system  of  administrative controls.  The Wall cannot be looked at on its own, but only in conjunction with the controls which are an integral part of the whole system. /n/nIt  is  when  one  looks  at  the  overall  picture  presented  by  the  Wall  and  its  accompanying controls that one fears for the future of the Palestinian inhabitants of the Occupied Territories.  It is consistent  with  what  is  known  already  of  the  Wall  to  see  in  its  construction  steps  aimed  at  the further assimilation of the Occupied Territories into Israel. /n/nAnd more than that, Mr. President, it obstructs the “permanent, free and unhindered access to  the  Holy  Places  by  all  the  people  of  all  religions  and  nationalities”.    That  has  been  a  major element  in  United  Nations  policy  on  Palestine  since  resolutions  191 (III)  and  194 (III)  in  1948. And it was reiterated by the General Assembly in resolution 57/111 of 2002. /n/nThe  map,  Mr. President,  also  shows  something  else.    It  shows  that,  despite  arguments  to the  contrary,  this  Wall  is  not  primarily  about  the  defence  of  Israels  territory.    One  glance  at  the route taken by the Wall gives the lie to that argument.  If the Wall is no more than a security barrier to  protect  the  territory  of  Israel,  why  does  it  follow  the  path  it  does?    How,  for  example,  does  a Wall encircling Qalqilya help to defend nearby Israeli territory?  What does the long finger of Wall extending  far  into  the  West  Bank  in  the  region  of  Salfit  have  to  do  with  the  defence  of  Israels territory?  How can the projected eastern stretch of the Wall, from Jenin in the north to Hebron in the  south,  be  justified  as  a  security  barrier  for  the  protection  of  Israels  territory,  when  there  is already the whole stretch of the Wall over to the west to serve for that alleged purpose?  If the Wall defends anything, it is  as we shall see in a moment  the position of Israeli settlements in the Occupied  Territories:    but  no  exceptional  right  of  self-defence  can  be  invoked,  Mr. President,  to defend  that  which  is  itself  unlawful.    Had  Israel  built  a  wall  wholly  within  its  own  territory,  we would  not  all  be  here  today.    And  I  would  just  observe  that  the  Court  has  been  given  no  cogent reasons why it was necessary to build this Wall in Occupied Territory, and why a wall built within Israels own territory would not have met the security concerns which are alleged to have provoked it. /n/nNow let me show one more sketch-map.  Still on the screen is the complete route of the Wall  constructed, planned and projected.  Now on the screen (and at tab 7 in the folders) is that same  map,  but  superimposed  on  it  are  the  locations  of  Israeli  settlements  in  the  Occupied Territories.    Although  settlements  are  spread  throughout  the  Occupied  Territories,  80 per cent  of the  settler  population  is  concentrated  in  the  western  areas,  now  being  pointed  out.    It  is  readily apparent  that  the  Wall  brings  the  main  groups  of  the  settlements  into  effective  contiguity  with Israels own territory;  it strengthens, develops and consolidates Israels settlements. /n/nThose  settlements  have  long  been  regarded  by  the  international  community  as  illegal56. And ever since the Wall began to be constructed, the international community has also regarded the Wall  as  illegal57.    Mr. President  and  Members  of  the  Court,  that  is  the  Wall  about  the  legal consequences of which the General Assembly has requested your opinion."

      "texto": "With  regard  to  Article 12  of  the  Charter,  let  me  refer  to  the  opinion  made  by  the honourable Judge Bruno Simma in his publication The Charter of the United Nations:  A Commentary  that  this  Article  has  been  gradually  eroded.    It  is  not  uncommon  that  the  General Assembly  has  made  recommendations  even  when  the  Security  Council  was  dealing  actively  with an  issue.    If  the  Security  Council  was  not  actually  exercising  its  function  at  that  moment,  or  if  a resolution  was  blocked  by  a  veto,  the  General  Assembly  has  assumed  that  it  is  free  to  make recommendations,  provided  that  these  did  not  directly  contradict  a  Security  Council  resolution41. /n/nThis  view  is  traditionally  legitimized  by  the  Uniting  for  Peace  Resolution  Mechanism42  which acknowledges  that  the  failure  of  the  Security  Council  to  discharge  its  responsibilities  does  not deprive  the  General  Assembly  of  its  rights  or  relieve  it  of  its  responsibilities  under  the  Charter. Having  said  that,  Indonesia  is  of  the  view  that  the  advisory  opinion  request  falls,  without  any doubt, within the scope of “functions” and “powers” of the General Assembly.  The argument that the advisory opinion request was ultra vires the competence of the General Assembly is therefore unfounded. /n/nMr. President,  distinguished  Members  of  the  Court,  a  State  or  group  of  States  might oppose  the  rendering  of  an  opinion  by  the  Court  on  the  ground  that  the  Courts  opinion  on  this question will jeopardize the negotiating process.  On the contrary, the impartial legal views of the Court  will  give  a  solid  international  legal  ground  to  speed  up  the  negotiating  process.    The negotiating process cannot be a “compelling reason” for the Court not to give its opinion.  There is no precedent that the impartial legal opinion of the World Court would hamper the peace process or create additional barriers for the negotiating process or  make the  “two-State” solution impossible. Indonesia  shares  the  view  that  the  establishment  of  a  Palestinian  State,  living  side  by  side  with Israel must be realized through political dialogue.  It consistently maintains that the interest of the very  fundamental  principle  of  international  law  shall  not  be  compromised.    As  mentioned  by  the distinguished Palestinian representative yesterday, the implementation of the peace process should not  be  at  the  expense  of  the  legal  rights  of  the  Palestinian  people.    In  this  regard,  the  Indonesian Government believes that the advisory opinion of the Court could contribute positively to the peace process. /n/nThe  positive  contribution  of  the  Court  to  the  peace  process  has  been  expressed  by  a Member  of  the  Court,  the  former  Judge  and  President,  Mohamed  Bedjaoui,  before  the  Sixth Committee  on  16 October  1995.    In  this  case,  Indonesia  also  endorses  the  preventive  nature  of advisory opinions.  Since an advisory opinion could provide an authoritative and important guide, advisory  procedure  appears  to  be  an  instrument  of  “preventive  diplomacy”,  as  envisaged  in “Agenda  for  Peace”,  which  is  a  particularly  suitable  means  for  the  Court  to  defuse  tension  and ward  off  conflicts  by  the  determination  of  law.    In  this  connection,  I  would  like  to  recall  the positive  contribution  of  the  Courts  Opinion  on  Namibia  to  the  establishment  of  the  rule  of international law in south-western Africa.  Within this context, Indonesia expects that an advisory opinion on this particular issue would be a legal building block for the peace process in the Middle East.  The impartial legal opinion of the Court on this question would provide a solid international legal ground ensuring that the negotiation process be fairly conducted in good faith."

      "texto": "Mr. President,  honourable  judges,  on  the  issue  of  legality,  Indonesia  strongly  believes that there is no legal justification for Israel to construct the Wall44.  The Wall is illegal because it is meant  to  ensure  control  of  the  Palestinian  Territories  through  various  measures.    By  building  the Wall,  the  Israeli  Government  has  ordered  vast  expropriations  of  land  and  has  destroyed  homes, shops, schools, water networks and agricultural land.  On the applicability of international humanitarian  law  in  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory,  the  construction  of  the  Wall  and  related access  arrangements  fail  to  meet  the  requirements  of  international  human  rights  and  humanitarian law. /n/nThe Wall violates Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Article 2 of the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  also  makes  it  clear  that  “no  distinction  shall  be  made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty”.  This approach is also confirmed by United Nations General Assembly resolution 48/121  (1993)  endorsing  the  “Vienna  Declaration  and  Action  Plan  from  the  World Conference  on  Human  Rights”.    It  explicitly  ensures  that  effective  international  measures,  to guarantee and monitor the implementation of a human rights standard, should be taken in respect of people under foreign occupation. /n/nAlthough Article 12 of the ICCPR stated that freedom of movement can be restricted for security reasons  but the restrictions should be limited to what is necessary and proportionate as mentioned  in  General  Comments  No. 27  adopted  by  the  Human  Rights  Committee51.    The  Wall creates  walled-in  enclaves  confining  tens  of  thousands  of  people.    It  sharply  limits  freedom  of movement  except  to  a  handful  of  permit-holders,  and  endangers  Palestinians  access  to  basic services  such  as  education  and  medical  care  and  other  access  to  work  and  water.    The  Israeli Government cannot use security concerns for Israelis living in illegal settlements to justify further illegal  changes  to  the  Occupied  Territory  by  constructing  illegal  barriers.    To  be  permissible, restrictions must be provided by law, must be necessary in a democratic society for the protection of  these  purposes  and  must  be  consistent  with  all  other  rights  recognized  in  the  Convention52. Restrictive measures must conform to the principle of proportionality;  they must be appropriate to achieve their protective function;  they must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might  achieve  the  desired  result;    and  they  must  be  proportionate  to  the  interest  to  be  protected53. The construction of a wall does not fulfil the obligation under Article 12 of the ICCPR. /n/nThe Wall also infringes on other Palestinian rights such as right to property as enshrined in  Article 17  of  the  Universal  Declaration  on  Human  Rights,  Article 1  of  the  ICESCR,  and Article 1 of the ICCPR;  the right to health as stated in Article 12 of the ICESCR and Article 56 of the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention;    the  right  to  education  as  stated  in  Article 3  of  the  ICESCR, Article 50  of  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention;    the  right  to  work  as  enshrined  in  Article 23  of  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 6 of the ICESCR;  the right to food and water as  stated  in  Article 11  of  the  ICESCR;    and  lastly,  the  right  to  freedom  of  religion  as  stated  in Article 18 of the ICCPR, and Article 58 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. /n/nThe  construction  of  the  Wall  by  Israel  in  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory,  including  East Jerusalem,  departing  from  the  Armistice  Line  of  1949,  is  illegal  under  relevant  norms  and principles of international law and must be ceased and reversed."

However,  time  and  again,  Israel  refuses  to  apply  the Fourth  Geneva  Convention  to  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory  even  though  the  international community called upon the Israeli Government to accept de jure application of the Fourth Geneva Convention  in  Palestine45.    Also  according  to  Article 2  of  the  ICCPR  Israel,  as  a  party,  must undertake  “to  respect  and  to  ensure  to  all  individuals  within  its  territory  and  subject  to  its jurisdiction  the  rights  recognized  in  the  present  Covenant”.    Since  Palestinian  Territories  are  not part  of  Israel,  it  should  strictly  follow  these  principles,  not  only  towards  its  nationals  but  also  in protecting  the  rights  of  Palestinians.    Israel  should  accept  the  applicability of  international  human rights  and  humanitarian  law.    Israel  should  also  incur  international  responsibilities  arising  from  a continuing violation of international obligations46. /n/nHonourable judges,  Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention ensures that the occupied population is entitled to certain rights that “protected persons . . . shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of  the  benefits  the  present  convention  by  any  change  introduced,  as  the  result  of  the occupation  of  a  territory,  into  the  institutions  or government  of  the  said  territory,  nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power”. International humanitarian law guarantees in Article 27 that “Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their  honor,  their  family  rights,  their  religious  convictions  and  practices,  and  their manners  and  customs.    They  shall  at  all  times  be  humanely  treated,  and  shall  be protected  especially  against  all  acts  of  violence  or  threats  thereof  and  against  insults and public curiosity.”47 The  Wall  is  a  combined  product  of  the  settlements  and  closure  policies.    The  Wall  adds  a permanent  barrier  to  the  barriers  already  put  in  place  through  checkpoints.    In  addition,  it  is  a permanent expropriation of private property. /n/nThe  “Bertini  Report”48  has  elaborated  on  the  humanitarian  situation  in  Palestine  and shown how closures, sieges, curfews and checkpoints are  strategies that have  affected the right to the freedom of movement and property.  The report states: “Palestinians  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  closures,  curfews,  roadblocks  and restrictions  that  have  caused  a  near-collapse  of  the  Palestine  economy . . .  and  rising dependency  on  humanitarian  assistance.    The  restrictions  affect  almost  all  activities, rendering  most  Palestinians  unable  to  carry  out  any  semblance  of  a  normal  life  and subject to daily hardships, deprivations and affronts to human dignity.”49 The  report  also  states  “There  is  a  consensus  among  all  parties,  and  this  report  confirms,  that  the current regime of closures and curfews is having a devastating impact on the Palestinian population, both on their economy and the humanitarian situation.” /n/nThe  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  in  its  press  release  of  18 February 2004, stated  inter  alia  its  concern  about  the  humanitarian  impact  of  the  West  Bank  barrier  on  many Palestinians living in the Occupied Territory.  The ICRCs opinion is that the West Bank barrier, in as  far  as  its  route  deviated  from  the  “Green  Line”  into  Occupied  Territory,  is  contrary  to international  humanitarian  law.    The  problems  affecting  the  Palestinian  population  in  their  daily lives clearly demonstrate that it runs counter to Israels obligation under international humanitarian law  to  ensure  the  humane  treatment  and  well-being  of  the  civilian  population  living  under  its occupation.  The measures taken by the Israeli authorities linked to the construction of the barrier in  the  Occupied  Territory  go  far  beyond  what  is  permissible  for  an  occupying  power  under international  humanitarian  law.    These  findings  are  based  on  the  ICRCs  monitoring  of  the  living conditions of the Palestinian population and on its analysis of the applicable international humanitarian  law  provisions.    The  Israeli  authorities  have  been  regularly  informed  about  the ICRCs  humanitarian  and  legal  concerns.    And  the  ICRC  therefore  calls  on  Israel  not  to  plan, construct, or maintain this barrier within the Occupied Territory. /n/nIsrael is under an obligation to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. /n/nAll  norms  and  principles  as  provided  by  international  human  rights  conventions  shall  be respected in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and therefore Israel is  under  obligations  to  stop  its  grave  breaches  of  international  human  rights  law,  and  to  bring all the perpetrators of human rights atrocities to justice."

In Cubas  view,  any  debate  on  the  optional  nature  of  Article 65,  paragraph 1,  of  the  Statute  is eminently theoretical in nature and can only be carried out in the light of the other Articles of said Statute and of the United Nations Charter. /n/nLikewise,  although  on  occasions  States  have  objected  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  based on the political nature of questions that have been placed before it, this has not prevented the Court from emitting consultative opinions on said questions, circumscribing itself to the legal consequences deriving from them, and, thus, adhering to its competence according to the internationally accepted instruments that govern its functioning. /n/nIt  is  Cubas  contention  that  the  emission  of  a  consultative  opinion  regarding  the  question presented  by  the  General  Assembly  is  based  not  only  on  Article 96  of  the  Charter,  but  also  on Article 14, which establishes that the General Assembly is competent to recommend measures for the  peaceful  solution  of  any  situation,  irrespective  of  origin,  even  a  situation  arising  from  a violation of the United Nations Charter itself. /n/nMention has been made in the written statements of the limitations imposed by Article 12 of the  Charter  to  the  fulfilment  by  the  General  Assembly  of  the  mandate  conferred  upon  it  by Article 14.  In Cubas view those limitations are not applicable in the cases involving requests for consultative  opinions  to  the  Court.    Article 96  of  the  Charter,  giving  this  faculty  to  the  General Assembly, is not qualified in any manner and, therefore, places no limitations whatsoever. /n/nFurthermore, even if Article 12 were to be theoretically applicable, limitations imposed by it would not be an obstacle for the request of a consultative opinion by the General Assembly on this issue.    The  fact  is  that  the  issue  at  hand  was  dealt  with  by  the  General  Assembly by virtue of  the United for Peace resolution resulting from a veto imposed by a Permanent Member of the Security Council  to  an  enabling  resolution.    Hence,  this  should  be  interpreted  in  the  sense  that,  for  all practical  purposes,  the  Security  Council  is  not  considering  the  draft  resolution  presented  to  it  and the item involved, even if said issue were still on the Councils agenda. /n/nThe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Cuba  considers  without  any  shadow  of  doubt whatsoever,  that  the  International  Court  of  Justice  is  competent  to  emit  a  consultative  opinion  on the legal question presented to it by the United Nations General  Assembly.  Articles 14 and 96 of the  United  Nations  Charter  and  Article 65,  paragraph 1,  of  the  Statute  of  the  Court  uphold  said competence.    Is  also  our  firm  view  that  the  emission  of  a  consultative  opinion  on  this  important issue is pertinent and timely. /n/nThe Government of the Republic of Cuba also considers that the emission of a consultative opinion on this important issue will not constitute an obstacle to the peace process but, on the contrary, would be an important tool in the hands of the United Nations General Assembly and  the  United  Nations  as  a  whole  for  the  fulfilment  of  its  functions  with  regard  to  this  conflict. Likewise,  it  can  contribute  to  clarify  to  the  international  community  the  terrible  socio-economic consequences for the Palestinian people derived from the construction of the Wall, particularly for the exercise of its inalienable right to self-determination."

Likewise, it has also the role of contributing to clarify to the international community as a whole the terrible socio-humanitarian consequences for the Palestinian people derived from the construction of the Wall and, particularly, for the exercise of its right  to  self-determination  and  for  the  establishment  of  a  sovereign  and  independent  Palestinian State. /n/nThe emission of a consultative opinion on this question should also be a dissuasive element for  the  Occupying  Power  geared  at  having  it  stop  and  revert  the  construction  of  the  Wall  in  the Occupied Palestinian Territory and it should, at least, be a strong call on the Occupying Power to comply with the wishes of the United Nations General Assembly, as expressed in resolution ES-10/13 of 21 October 2003. /n/nThe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Cuba  respectfully  hopes  that  the  International  Court of Justice, while emitting the consultative opinion requested by the General Assembly, recognizes that  the  construction  of  the  Wall  by  Israel  is  illegal  and  in  violation  of  norms  and  principles  of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. /n/nLastly,  Cuba  hopes  that  the  International  Court  of  Justice  acts  in  a  decisive  and unanimous manner in favour of peace and justice.  The Wall of separation continues to accentuate the illegal Israeli occupation, and perpetuates the system of “apartheid” established by Israel in the Occupied  Palestinian  Territory.

      "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "In addition, the General Assembly, by resolution ES-10/13, of 21 October 2003, established that the construction of the Wall is an issue that has clear implications for international law.  Said resolution, in its paragraph 1, “Demands that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the Wall in the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory,  including  in  and  around  East  Jerusalem,  which  is  in departure of the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to relevant provisions of International Law”. /n/nHonourable judges, with regard to the Republic of Cubas position on the most salient facts derived from the construction of the Wall, my delegation wishes to reiterate that the situation in the Occupied  Palestinian  Territory  has  always  been  a  source  of  deep  concern  for  my  country.    For decades, Israel, the Occupying Power, has been responsible for continuous and flagrant violations of human rights, of international humanitarian law and of international law in said territory and has ignored resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. /n/nAt present, according to available public information, the situation is even more critical.  The construction  of  the  Wall  supposes  in  the  short-term  a  humanitarian  catastrophe  that  could  be conducive  to  the  extermination  and  genocide  of  the  Palestinian  people,  while,  at  the  same  time, conditioning,  from  the  physical  point  of  view,  the  co-existence  of  two  sovereign  and  independent States in the region, Israel and Palestine. /n/nThe construction of the Wall violates principles and norms of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and international law. /n/nIf the layout of the Wall foreseen by the authorities of the Occupying Power is carried out, it would  deviate  from  the  Armistice  Line  of  1949  (Green  Line)  up  to  22 km  in  several  places, annexing important zones of the West Bank and in and around Jerusalem. /n/nThe  Occupying  Power,  with  this  act,  would  de  facto  establish  a  new  border  by  means  of unilateral  imposition  and  the  use  of  the  force,  by  means  of  a  separation  wall  between  the Palestinian  Territory  occupied  in  the  war  of  aggression  carried  out  by  Israel  in  1967,  and  its  own State.    By  virtue  of  international  law,  an  aggressor  State  cannot  acquire  a  territory  by  means  of unilateral annexation. /n/nThe construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory also qualifies as an illicit act of annexation in accordance with the provisions of resolutions 478 (1980) and 497 (1981) of the United  Nations  Security  Council,  which  declare  that  the  acts  of  Israel  geared  at  the  annexation  of East Jerusalem and the Golan are null and void, and should not be recognized by States. /n/nThe  construction  of  the  Wall  also  ignores  the  principle  of  the  equality  of  rights  and self-determination of peoples.  The right to self-determination is founded on Article 1, paragraph 2, and  on  Article 55  of  the  United  Nations  Charter.    It  was  sanctioned  also  in  Article 1  of  the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Cultural, Social, and Economic Rights. /n/nLikewise,  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  has  ratified  this  principle  in  numerous resolutions.    Among  the  most  noteworthy,  it  is  found  in  resolution  1514  (XV)  of  the  fifteenth session  of  the  General  Assembly,  on  the  Declaration  on  the  concession  of  independence  to  the colonial countries and peoples, and in the aforementioned resolution 2625 (XXV) of the twenty-fifth session. /n/nThe  construction  of  the  Wall  goes  against  the  principle  of  peaceful  solution  of  disputes. Article 2,  paragraph 3,  of  the  United  Nations  Charter  establishes  that  States  should  resolve  their disputes  by  peaceful  means.    Thus,  any  delimitation  of  borders  should  be  negotiated  between  the two parties concerned on the basis of equality and equity for both which clearly derives from this principle.    The  parties  should  be  placed  on  equal  terms  and  each  one  of  them  should  respect  the rights of the other in accordance with international law.  The unilateral construction of the Wall by the  Occupying  Power,  in  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory,  is  in  no  way  conducive  to  a  climate propitious to the peaceful and negotiated solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on equal terms. /n/nHonourable  judges,  it  is  crystal  clear  that  the  construction  of  the  Wall  goes  against  the provisions contained in a number of resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. /n/nThe  consideration  of  these  resolutions  also  demonstrates  that  the  systematic  refusal  by  the Occupying Power to comply with the provisions contained therein regarding the acts committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, entails legal consequences for the Occupying Power. /n/nIn addition, the non-compliance by the Occupying Power of United Nations resolutions is in conflict with the principle of good faith, one of the fundamental principles of international law. /n/nThe  construction  of  the  Wall  in  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory  is  also  in  violation  of resolutions  adopted  by  the  United  Nations  bodies  in  the  context  of  the  Israeli  settlements  in  the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nFurthermore,  the  construction  of  the  Wall  by  the  Occupying  Power  violates  principles  and norms of international humanitarian law. /n/nFirst and foremost, Cuba sustains that the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 regarding the  protection  of  civilian  persons  in  times  of  war,  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention,  is  fully applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Reference should be made to the violations by Israel, the Occupying Power, of said Convention. /n/nThough  Israel  has  contended  that  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention  is  not  applicable  to  the Occupied  Palestinian  Territory  as  it  is  “not  a  territory  of  a  High  Contracting  Party  as  required  by the  Convention”,  the  applicability  of  this  instrument  to  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory  enjoys extensive international recognition.  The written presentation delivered by the Republic of Cuba on 30 January 2004 to this Court, contains legal and factual elements confirming this assertion.  At the same  time,  Israel,  as  Occupying  Power,  is  also  legally  bound  by  other  consuetudinary  norms relating to occupation, according to the stipulations of the Rules annexed to the Hague Convention on Laws and Customs of Land Wars of 18 October 1907. /n/nIn  the  view  of  the  Republic  of  Cuba,  as  a  result  of  the  construction  of  the  Wall  and  of  the severe humanitarian and socio-economic conditions that this has entailed and will continue to entail for  the  population  of  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory,  the  Occupying  Power  incurs  in  a  large number of very serious violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention. /n/nIt violates the obligation emanating from Article 1, common to the four Geneva Conventions, according to which the “High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect of said Convention in all circumstances”. /n/nAs a result of the construction of the Wall and of the establishment of arbitrary restrictions to the  movement  of  Palestinian  persons  and  goods  from  one  side  of  the  Wall  to the  other,  access  by the  Palestinian  population  to  their  lands,  jobs,  markets  and  other  sources  of  subsistence  has  been severely limited, with which the Palestinian economy has been severely affected and its population subjected  to  unsustainable  conditions.    This  situation  clearly  demonstrates  that  the  Occupying Power  has  not  fulfilled  its  obligation  to  provide  these  persons  with  the  opportunity  to  find  paid employment,  according  to  provisions  included  in  Article 39,  paragraph 1,  of  the  Fourth  Geneva Convention. /n/nLikewise,  the  Occupying  Power  has  not  fulfilled  the  provisions  of  paragraph 2  of  said Article 39, according to which “where a Party to the conflict applies to a protected person methods of control which result  in  his  being  unable  to  support  himself,  and  especially  if  such  a  person  is prevented for reasons of security from finding paid employment on reasonable conditions, the said Party shall ensure his support and that of his dependents”. In this context, the Occupying Power has not fulfilled the provisions of Article 55, paragraph 1, of the Fourth Geneva Convention, according to which “the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population;  it should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the Occupied Territory are inadequate”."

      "texto": "Through  its  presentation,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Cuba  reiterates  inter  alia,  its condemnation of acts of annexation, to the excessive use of force without establishing a distinction between civilians and combatants, to the creation of a humanitarian crisis caused by the limitations imposed on the circulation of goods and persons, to the inhuman treatment of children, and to the generalized destruction of goods, all of which are a direct consequence of the territorial expansion of  the  Occupying  Power  through  the  construction  of  the  Wall,  and  all  of  which  have  clear  legal consequences. /n/nThe right to self-determination of the Palestinian people cannot be alienated and it should be realized on the basis of territorial integrity within the borders of an independent Palestinian State. This right of the Palestinian people has been confirmed by the United Nations General Assembly in numerous  resolutions,  and  also  recognized  in  the  different  phases  of  the  peace  process  in  the Middle East. /n/nThe  right  to  self-determination  is  closely  linked  with  the  concept  of  territorial  sovereignty. A people can only exercise the right to self-determination within a territory.  The amputation of the Palestinian  territory  by  means  of  the  construction  of  a  wall  is  a  serious  breach  of  the  inalienable right  to  self-determination  of  the  Palestinian  people,  since  it  considerably  reduces  the  size  of  the already small self-determination unit within which such right should be exercised. /n/nThis  situation  must  cease.    Israel,  the  Occupying  Power,  has  the  obligation  to  stop  and  to revert the construction of the Wall, while the international community, on the other hand, has also the  obligation  of  not  recognizing  the  control by  the  Occupying Power  of  the  Palestinian  Territory delimited by the Wall. /n/nAccording  to  international  law  the  prohibition  of  acquiring  territories  by  force  applies independently  of  any  other  consideration.  The  Declaration  on  Principles  of  International  Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,  that  is  resolution 2625  of  the  Twenty-Fifth  Session  of  the  General  Assembly (24 October 1970), establishes that “the territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force.  No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”. /n/nThe  actions  adopted  by  Israel,  the  Occupying  Power,  of  building  a  wall  in  the  Occupied Palestinian Territory is not justified in any way whatsoever by military necessities. /n/nIt  violates,  furthermore,  the  principle  of  proportionality,  as  it  is  not  proportionate  with legitimate  security  interests,  moves  away  from  measures  of  that  character  and  acquires  the  nature of punishment, humiliation and conquest. /n/nIt must be recalled that, because of their special nature, the norms of international humanitarian  law  establish  obligations  applicable  to  the  international  community  as  a  whole. Therefore, every member of the international community is entitled to demand that said norms be respected. /n/nWith the destruction of dwellings, stores, cultivated lands and other goods belonging to the Palestinian population by the construction of the Wall, the Occupying Power is violating Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention according to which “any destruction by the occupying Power of real estate or personal property belonging individually  or  collectively  to  private  persons,  or  to  the  State,  or  to  other  public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations”. In Cubas view, the exception foreseen in this Article is not applicable to this case. /n/nKeeping in mind the previously mentioned violations of the rights of the “protected population”,  in  this  case  the  Palestinian  population  resided  in  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory, the  Occupying  Power  is  also  violating  Article  47  of  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention,  according  to which “protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention...”. /n/nAll  the  violations  of  the  provisions  of  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention  above  described, represent,  furthermore,  a  humiliation  to  the  Palestinian  people  by  virtue  of  Article 27  of  said instrument, according to which “protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and  customs.    They  shall  at  all  times  be  humanely  treated,  and  shall  be  protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof...” In  all  evidence,  the  construction  of  the  Wall,  with  its  concrete  structure,  its  razor  wire,  its towers of observation and its electronic monitoring means, creates a population of prisoners. /n/nIn addition to the above, the disproportionate and excessive use of the concept of the right to legitimate  defence  by  the  Occupying  Power,  and  the  violation  of  the  principles  of  proportionality and distinction derived from the construction of the Wall should be also considered. /n/nThe Occupying Power intends to justify the construction of a Wall in the occupied Palestinian territory as being a security measure by virtue of the exercise by States of their right to legitimate  defence.    In  accordance  with  the  United  Nations  Charter  and  international  law,  States have the right to exercise  said right individually or collectively in the case of an armed attack for the protection of its legitimate security interests, and in cases of strict military necessity. Nevertheless, distinguished Members of the Court, those actions should be compliant with international human rights norms and international humanitarian law. /n/nIsrael, the Occupying Power, persists in serious violations of the provisions of the Fourth Geneva  Convention  of  1949.    It  still  refuses  to  accept  the  de  jure  applicability  and  even  the application  of  the  Convention  to  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory,  including  Jerusalem,  thus demonstrating  its  refusal  to  respect  the  wish  of  the  international  community,  that  for  more  than 30 years has confirmed the applicability of this Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nThe  extreme  humanitarian  crisis  imposed  by  the  Occupying  Power  on  the  Palestinian population  since  the  construction  of  the  Wall,  as  described  in  the  report  of  the  Secretary-General and  in  other  public  sources,  may  be  classified  as  a  crime  of  extermination,  as  it  constitutes  the intentional  infliction  of  conditions  of  life,  calculated  to  bring  about  the  destruction  of  part  of  a population, in this case the Palestinian population. /n/nThe  Government  of  the  Republic  of Cuba  equally  expects  that  the  International  Court  of Justice recognize the international responsibility derived for the Occupying Power by the illicit acts previously  expressed.    Likewise,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Cuba  considers  that  the stopping of the process of construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory cannot be postponed, and respectfully requests the Court to demand that the Wall be totally demolished and that the Occupying Power unrestrictedly fulfil its obligations under international law and international humanitarian law."

      "texto": "The General Assembly has come to the Court to seek and to obtain clarification on the legal consequences arising from the construction of the Wall being built by Israel, considering the rules and  principles  of  international  law,  and  to  obtain  further  legal  guidance  that  will  assist  the international community to determine its response.  No institution is better placed than your Court to assess in an authoritative way the situation from an international law perspective. /n/nThe Wall, sections of which are constructed deep inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, departs from the Armistice Line of 1949 and is therefore illegal under international law. This implies the violation of the obligation to respect the territorial integrity of Palestine and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. /n/nThe Wall gravely violates the Fourth Geneva Convention in that it involves the illegal, de facto attempt at annexation of substantial parts of the Palestinian territory and its resources; the transfer of a large number of Palestinian civilians, and further deprivation of human rights of the Palestinians, resulting in further dire humanitarian consequences among an already deprived people. /n/nThe Wall constitutes a unilateral action. It harms the process of implementation of the Road Map. It undermines the effective creation of the Palestinian State. All of this implies a violation of the obligation to pursue negotiations in good faith. /n/nFourthly, the General Assembly adopted on 21 October 2003 the above-mentioned resolution A/ES-10/13, co-sponsored by the European Union and its acceding and associated members. The Assembly demanded that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, considering that this construction is in contradiction with relevant provisions of international law and requested the Secretary-General to report on compliance with the resolution. The Security Councils failure to adopt a resolution to the same effect was only because of the exercise of a veto. On 24 November, the United Nations Secretary-General submitted a very disturbing report on the non-compliance of Israel with the European Union-initiated Assembly resolution, describing the poor conditions and deprivation of human rights of the Palestinian people and the failure to achieve a peaceful solution. Given this situation, it became imperative upon the Assembly to act. /n/nMoreover, the other so-called “half” of the question, that is the struggle against terrorism, was raised by Israel to justify the construction of the Wall. As reiterated in our Written Statement, Malaysia has always and consistently condemned all forms and manner of terrorism. Internationally, its unequivocal position on terrorism is well known and on record. But Malaysia has also consistently reaffirmed that the struggle against terrorism must be accomplished within the realm of international law and not in violation thereof. As demonstrated in Malaysias Written Statement, the construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory cannot be justified on the ground of self-defence, the only circumstance precluding wrongfulness invoked by Israel. Indeed, no other circumstance precluding wrongfulness could be rightfully raised. The conditions required by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility adopted by the International Law Commission to invoke such circumstances as necessity, distress or counter-measures, are clearly not met here. To mention just one reason, the construction of the Wall constitutes a violation of peremptory norms of international law, such as the right to self-determination of peoples and the respect of the territorial integrity of other countries. Palestine is already such a fragile and small entity and there should be no other encroachment of its territory and its natural resources. /n/nIn our Written Statement Malaysia elaborated the main argument why the Court should comply with the General Assemblys request for an advisory opinion. It is also the main reason why the construction of the Wall is illegal: the Occupied Palestinian Territory is one under international supervision, for which the United Nations in general and the General Assembly in particular have a special responsibility. This responsibility will last until the whole of the former British Mandated Territory achieves a final status, that is, by the effective existence of two States one Arab and the other Jewish living side by side in peace. /n/nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions have clearly and insistently determined that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel simply cannot validly deny these determinations by the United Nations in discharge of the Organizations special responsibilities for a territory under international supervision. Hence, in this case the Court is not facing a bilateral boundary dispute, or even less, an attempt to request the Court to consider a boundary dispute in another guise, as some have liked us to believe. In its Written Statement, Israel deliberately misrepresented what Malaysia stated in the General Assembly, in order to prove that the intention of the request for an advisory opinion is to solve a bilateral dispute between Palestine and Israel in favour of the former. No, Mr. President, it is not a bilateral dispute, it is the continuous defiance by Israel of the whole international community with regard to a territory for which the United Nations has a special responsibility and in which the entire international community has a particular interest. Yes, Mr. President, we would like to say again and again: “justice must be done in Palestine”. This refers primarily to the respect for international law. /n/nIsrael has adopted a position with regard to the legal status of the Palestinian territory akin to that followed by South Africa with regard to Namibia during the period of the unlawful occupation of Namibia. Israel assumes, without legal justification, to have “rights” over the territory. Legally, the Palestinian situation is even more straightforward than those in the Namibia and Western Sahara Advisory Opinions. Initially, South Africa had a legal title to administer South West Africa as a Mandatory Power, until this Mandate was validly revoked by the General Assembly in 1966. In the case of Western Sahara, Spain was recognized as the Administering Power of a non-self-governing territory. In the case of the Occupied Palestinian Territory none of this has occurred. Israel simply has no legal title to administer a territory under international supervision. It is merely a belligerent occupier. Israel is in a pure de facto situation. /n/nMoreover, it is an indisputable fact that Israel did not claim any title to the West Bank before 1967. Even in the aftermath of the six-day war, and with the exception of Jerusalem, there was “no claim to annexation or title”, as Judge Rosalyn Higgins rightly pointed out in an article written after the war. /n/nIndeed, by establishing a de facto unilateral demarcation line by constructing the Wall, Israel is also violating the obligation to respect the Green Line. As explained in Malaysias written statement, whatever the intention of the construction of the Wall, it clearly purports to establish a new separation line. Israelis have freedom of movement west of the Wall but Palestinians need a permit. One of the justifications advanced in the Israeli Written Statement is another clear evidence of this. I quote: “the fence will be moved to reflect any agreement between the parties”. If this will be the case, then the construction of the Wall is nothing else than a unilateral demarcation line imposed upon the other party now, until “any agreement between the parties” will be reached. Moreover, it could be difficult to find any stronger evidence that the Wall is not a simple “temporary measure against terrorism”, but a true de facto separation line aimed at annexation of Palestinian territory than that provided by the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel. It refers to the “Western, or Israeli side of the security fence”! /n/nThe insistence of Israel in comparing its “fence” in the West Bank, including in and around Jerusalem, with those existing at the borders with Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, provides yet another striking evidence that the Israeli Governments purpose in constructing the Wall is not simply to prevent terrorism, but to establish a physical line separating two different areas of exercise of territorial control. Whilst not insisting here upon the “unilateral disengagement plan” as announced by the Israeli Prime Minister, this plan proves indisputably the intentions of the Government of Israel in constructing the Wall."

      "texto": "Equally, in terms of the law of armed conflict there is no military necessity for Israel to build a wall in a territory it already occupies. From a human rights law perspective the Wall cannot justify the non-compliance with core human rights that are of a non-derogatory nature, even during a state of public emergency. Assuming that the Wall is being constructed in order to protect Israeli citizens within Israel, the Wall should be built on Israeli territory. Furthermore, if an additional main concern is to provide security to the Israeli citizens illegally settled on occupied Palestinian territory, then the best way is to withdraw from those illegal settlements. In any event, to accommodate the security concerns of these illegal Israeli settlements can never be to the detriment of the security and living conditions of the Palestinian people within their own territory and lands. /n/nThe Court will have no difficulty in finding as legal consequences of the construction of the Wall that it neither affects Palestinian sovereignty over the territory lying between the Wall and the Green Line nor creates any territorial right whatsoever in favour of Israel. Moreover, Israel itself, in trying to justify the construction of the Wall, has recognized that the “fence”, as Israel calls it, does not “annex any Palestinian lands” and “does not establish a border”. Hence, since the territories lying between the Green Line and the Wall are internationally recognized as being Palestinian territory, since they have not been claimed as Israeli territory and since they have come under Israeli control only by virtue of military occupation in 1967, the construction and maintenance of the Wall does not affect Palestinian sovereignty and does not create any territorial right in favour of Israel."

    "texto": "\n\n1.Lack of Competence Due to Article 12 of the UN Charter:\n\nArticle 12, paragraph 1, of the UN Charter states that while the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\n\nThe Security Council was actively engaged with the situation in the Middle East, specifically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Given this engagement, the General Assembly's request for an advisory opinion might be seen as a recommendation concerning a matter under the Security Council's purview, which contravenes Article 12.
    \n\n2. Involvement in Domestic Affairs: The construction of the wall involves intricate issues of domestic policy and security, particularly for Israel. The ICJs involvement in what could be construed as a domestic affair might infringe on national sovereignty and set a precedent for international interference in internal matters. This could lead to a broader erosion of state sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs, which are fundamental tenets of international law.
    \n\n3. Risk of Escalating Tensions: An advisory opinion from the ICJ, regardless of its content, might inflame tensions in an already volatile region. Parties on either side of the conflict may use the opinion to justify further actions, potentially escalating violence and undermining peace efforts. The potential for misinterpretation or selective application of the opinion by different stakeholders could exacerbate distrust and hostility, further complicating efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
    \n\n4. Lack of Binding Force: Advisory opinions of the ICJ are not legally binding. The non-binding nature of the opinion could render it ineffective in compelling compliance, particularly from parties deeply entrenched in their positions. This could lead to a situation where the ICJs advisory opinions are ignored, diminishing the Courts perceived authority and weakening the international legal framework as a whole. Without enforceability, the advisory opinion risks being disregarded by the parties involved, thereby undermining its significance and impact on the resolution of the conflict.
    \n\n5. Precedent of Judicial Activism: Issuing an advisory opinion in this context might be seen as judicial activism, where the ICJ is perceived as stepping beyond its traditional role to influence political outcomes. This activism could provoke criticism and reduce the Courts legitimacy. By wading into such a politically charged issue, the ICJ risks being perceived as biased or partial, undermining its reputation as an impartial arbiter of international law. This could lead to a loss of trust in the Court's judgments and weaken the credibility of international legal institutions."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Ultra Vires Action by the General Assembly:\n\nIt can be argued that the General Assembly exceeded its authority (acted ultra vires) by requesting an advisory opinion on a matter actively handled by the Security Council. This overreach challenges the balance of power and responsibilities outlined in the UN Charter, specifically Articles 12 and 24, which assign primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security to the Security Council.
    \n\n2. Potential for Misuse by Political Entities: The advisory opinion might be used by political entities to further their own agendas, rather than to promote justice or peace. This misuse could politicize the ICJs decision and detract from its intended purpose of providing legal clarity. Political actors may selectively interpret or cherry-pick elements of the opinion to serve their interests, leading to further polarization and entrenchment of positions. This could undermine the credibility of the ICJ and international law more broadly, as its judgments are perceived as being driven by political considerations rather than legal principles.
    \n\n3. Undermining the Security Councils Role: The Security Council is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security. By seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ, the General Assembly may be seen as undermining the Security Councils role and authority, leading to inter-organ conflict within the UN. This could weaken the effectiveness of the Security Council in addressing conflicts and crises around the world, as its decisions are circumvented or undermined by other UN bodies. Such discord within the UN system could hinder collective action and diminish the organization's ability to respond to global challenges.
    \n\n4. Complications from Multiple Legal Frameworks: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves multiple legal frameworks, including international law, humanitarian law, and domestic law. The ICJs attempt to navigate these overlapping frameworks could result in an overly complex and potentially contradictory opinion that fails to provide clear guidance. This could create confusion among the parties involved and hinder efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution. Moreover, conflicting legal interpretations could exacerbate tensions and impede progress towards a negotiated settlement, further entrenching the status quo and perpetuating the cycle of violence and conflict.
    \n\n5. Potential for Partiality Perception: Given the highly politicized nature of the conflict, any advisory opinion issued by the ICJ might be perceived as partial or biased, regardless of its legal soundness. This perception could damage the Courts reputation for impartiality and fairness, undermining its credibility as an objective adjudicator of international disputes. The risk of perceived partiality could erode trust in the ICJ among the parties involved and diminish the likelihood of them accepting the Court's opinion as a basis for resolving the conflict. This could further prolong the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and impede efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace.
    \n\n6. Impact on Future Legal Proceedings: An advisory opinion in this case could set a precedent that influences future legal proceedings involving similar conflicts. This precedent might limit the ICJs flexibility and discretion in handling diverse and unique international disputes in the future. Parties to future conflicts may cite the advisory opinion as precedent in their own cases, leading to a narrowing of legal arguments and a lack of innovation in the application of international law. This could hinder the development of international jurisprudence and impede efforts to address emerging challenges in the global legal landscape."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Inconsistency with the Uniting for Peace Resolution (377 A (V)):\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was convened under the Uniting for Peace resolution, which allows the General Assembly to act in the face of Security Council inaction. However, the Security Council had been actively considering the situation, evidenced by various draft resolutions and debates, even though no conclusive resolution was passed due to vetoes.\n\nThe rolling character of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, where it was convened multiple times over several years, raises procedural concerns. This approach could be seen as a manipulation of procedural norms to bypass the Security Council's authority, undermining the established processes and the intended exceptional nature of the Uniting for Peace resolution.
    \n\n2. Challenges in Enforcing Compliance: The ICJ lacks the enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with its advisory opinions. In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where non-compliance with international resolutions is already an issue, the advisory opinion might be ignored, further eroding the credibility of international law. Without meaningful consequences for non-compliance, the advisory opinion risks being dismissed as toothless by the parties involved, undermining the authority and effectiveness of the ICJ as a judicial institution. This could perpetuate a cycle of impunity and disregard for international legal norms, exacerbating conflict and insecurity in the region.
    \n\n3. Question of Timeliness: The timing of the advisory opinion request might be inappropriate, given the current state of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With ongoing negotiations and efforts at peace, the advisory opinion might disrupt delicate diplomatic processes and hinder progress. Parties to the conflict may view the ICJs involvement as premature or unwarranted, undermining confidence in the Courts ability to contribute constructively to the resolution of the conflict. Moreover, issuing an advisory opinion at a sensitive juncture could escalate tensions and derail efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement, prolonging the suffering of the affected populations and perpetuating instability in the region.
    \n\n4. Complexity of the Issue: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is characterized by deep historical, cultural, and political complexities that defy easy resolution. The construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is just one aspect of this multifaceted conflict. Given the intricate nature of the issues involved, the ICJ may struggle to provide a comprehensive and nuanced advisory opinion that addresses all relevant factors. Attempting to simplify such a complex issue into a legal judgment risks oversimplification and may fail to capture the full scope of the conflict, leading to potential inaccuracies or omissions in the Court's analysis.
    \n\n5. Potential for Polarization: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ has the potential to further polarize stakeholders in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Depending on the content of the opinion, it may be perceived as favoring one party over the other, exacerbating existing divisions and fueling resentment. This polarization could hinder efforts to build trust and foster dialogue between the parties, making it more difficult to reach a negotiated settlement. Additionally, it may increase the likelihood of retaliatory actions or escalations of violence as parties react to perceived injustices or biases in the Court's decision.
    \n\n6. Challenges in Implementation: Even if the ICJ were to issue a comprehensive and impartial advisory opinion, implementing its recommendations on the ground presents significant practical challenges. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is marked by deeply entrenched positions and a lack of mutual trust, making it difficult to secure compliance with external legal judgments. Moreover, the logistical and political obstacles to implementing changes on the ground, such as dismantling portions of the wall, are substantial. Without robust mechanisms for enforcement and international support for implementation, the advisory opinion may have limited impact in bringing about tangible changes in the situation.
    \n\n7. Potential for Unintended Consequences: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ carries the risk of unintended consequences that may exacerbate rather than alleviate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For example, if the opinion is perceived as biased or unfair by one or both parties, it could lead to a breakdown in diplomatic relations or a hardening of positions. Similarly, if the opinion is overly restrictive or prescriptive in its recommendations, it may inadvertently undermine the ability of the parties to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution. Anticipating and mitigating these potential unintended consequences requires careful consideration of the broader geopolitical context and potential reactions from all stakeholders.
    \n\n8. Impact on Humanitarian Situation: The focus on legal proceedings and advisory opinions may divert attention and resources away from addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of the affected populations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The construction of the wall has significant humanitarian implications, including restrictions on freedom of movement, access to essential services, and livelihood opportunities for Palestinians. While legal accountability is important, it should not overshadow the immediate needs of those impacted by the conflict. The ICJ must consider the humanitarian consequences of its actions and prioritize efforts to alleviate the suffering of vulnerable populations in its decision-making process.
    \n\n9. Potential for Legalization of Political Issues: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict risks further politicizing and legalizing what is fundamentally a complex political issue. By framing the conflict in legal terms and deferring to a judicial body for resolution, there is a danger of oversimplifying the root causes of the conflict and sidelining political negotiations. This approach may reinforce the perception that legal mechanisms alone can address deep-seated political grievances, undermining the need for sustained diplomatic efforts and compromise-based solutions. Balancing the legal dimensions of the conflict with its underlying political dynamics is essential to avoid exacerbating tensions and promoting genuine peacebuilding efforts.
    \n\n10. Potential for Undermining Peace Processes: The involvement of the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through an advisory opinion may undermine ongoing peace processes and diplomatic initiatives aimed at resolving the conflict through negotiations. External legal interventions, particularly those perceived as biased or one-sided, have the potential to disrupt delicate negotiations and erode trust between the parties. The pursuit of legal avenues for addressing the conflict may detract attention and resources from diplomatic efforts to build confidence, foster dialogue, and reach mutually acceptable agreements. To avoid undermining existing peace processes, any legal interventions must be carefully coordinated and supportive of broader peacebuilding objectives.
    \n\n11. Risk of Setting Dangerous Precedents: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may set dangerous precedents for the resolution of similar conflicts around the world. If the Court's decision is perceived as legitimizing unilateral actions or disregarding the principles of self-determination and territorial sovereignty, it could embolden other states to pursue similar courses of action in their own disputes. This could contribute to a destabilizing trend of unilateralism and disregard for international norms and agreements, undermining efforts to uphold the rule of law and promote peaceful conflict resolution on a global scale."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Security Councils Continued Responsibility: The adoption of Security Council resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the Quartet's Roadmap for peace, indicates the Councils continued engagement and responsibility in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This continued responsibility implies that the General Assemblys request for an advisory opinion might interfere with ongoing Security Council efforts, contravening the intended division of labor between these two UN organs.
    \n\n2. Limited Scope for Addressing Root Causes: While the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is a significant issue, an advisory opinion from the ICJ may have limited scope in addressing the underlying root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflict is multifaceted and deeply rooted in historical grievances, competing claims to land and resources, and complex geopolitical dynamics. Focusing solely on the legality of the wall may overlook broader issues related to statehood, sovereignty, refugee rights, and the status of Jerusalem, among others. Without addressing these fundamental issues comprehensively, any legal opinion risks providing only a partial solution to the conflict and may fail to achieve lasting peace.
    \n\n3. Potential for Exacerbating Regional Tensions: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not isolated but is intertwined with broader regional dynamics and geopolitical interests. An advisory opinion from the ICJ has the potential to exacerbate tensions not only between Israel and Palestine but also among regional actors with vested interests in the conflict. Countries in the Middle East and beyond may view the ICJ's involvement as interference in regional affairs and may respond with diplomatic, economic, or military measures that further destabilize the region. The risk of escalation and the potential for unintended consequences underscore the need for cautious and strategic decision-making regarding the ICJ's role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
    \n\n4. Challenges in Achieving Consensus: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is characterized by deep-seated divisions and a lack of consensus on key issues among the parties involved and the international community. Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ may be seen as an attempt to circumvent the challenges of achieving consensus through diplomatic negotiations and compromise. However, the Court's decision is unlikely to be universally accepted or implemented without broad-based support from all stakeholders. In the absence of consensus, the advisory opinion risks further polarizing the parties and undermining efforts to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the conflict.
    \n\n5. Complex Interplay of Legal Frameworks: The legal aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are intertwined with a complex web of international, regional, and domestic legal frameworks, including international humanitarian law, human rights law, and domestic Israeli and Palestinian law. Navigating these overlapping legal frameworks presents significant challenges for the ICJ in providing a coherent and comprehensive advisory opinion. The Court must carefully consider the interactions between these different legal regimes and ensure that its decision reflects a balanced and principled approach to international law.
    \n\n6. Need for Holistic Approach to Peacebuilding: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a holistic approach that addresses not only legal issues but also political, economic, social, and humanitarian dimensions. While the ICJ can provide valuable legal insights, it cannot single-handedly resolve the underlying grievances and mistrust that fuel the conflict. Efforts to achieve peace and reconciliation must involve a range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, and grassroots movements, and must prioritize dialogue, confidence-building measures, and mutual respect. Relying solely on legal mechanisms to address the conflict risks oversimplifying its complexity and may hinder efforts to build sustainable peace in the long term.
    \n\n7. Potential for Legalization of Historical Injustices: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may inadvertently legitimize historical injustices and violations of international law. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rooted in a long history of dispossession, displacement, and human rights abuses, including the establishment of Israeli settlements and the construction of the separation barrier. By focusing narrowly on the legality of specific actions, the ICJ's decision may fail to address broader issues of accountability, reparations, and justice for victims of past and ongoing violations. This risks perpetuating cycles of impunity and undermining efforts to achieve truth, reconciliation, and meaningful redress for affected communities.
    \n\n8. Risk of Legalization of Unilateral Actions: An advisory opinion from the ICJ on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may inadvertently legitimize unilateral actions taken by states in violation of international law. By providing a legal justification or rationale for such actions, the ICJ's decision could set a dangerous precedent that undermines the principles of collective security, multilateralism, and respect for international law. This risks emboldening states to pursue their interests through unilateral means, disregarding the rights and interests of other states and perpetuating conflicts and instability. To avoid enabling unilateralism, the ICJ must carefully consider the broader implications of its decision and prioritize the principles of justice, equity, and respect for international norms and agreements.
    \n\n9. Need for Contextual Understanding: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a nuanced understanding of the historical, cultural, and political context in which it has evolved. While legal analysis can provide valuable insights, it must be complemented by a contextual understanding of the root causes, grievances, and aspirations of the parties involved. The ICJ must take into account the lived experiences of Palestinians and Israelis, the legacy of colonization and dispossession, and the broader regional dynamics that shape the conflict. Without a deep understanding of these complex realities, any legal opinion risks oversimplifying the issues at stake and may fail to resonate with the affected populations or contribute to lasting peace.
    \n\n10. Importance of Diplomatic Engagement: Diplomatic engagement and dialogue are essential for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and achieving a just and lasting peace. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions can play a role in clarifying legal principles and norms, they cannot substitute for meaningful diplomatic engagement and negotiation between the parties. The ICJ's involvement should complement, rather than replace, diplomatic efforts aimed at building trust, fostering dialogue, and addressing the underlying causes of the conflict. By prioritizing diplomacy and cooperation, stakeholders can work together to find mutually acceptable solutions that promote peace, security, and prosperity for all parties involved."

Holding an emergency special session concurrently with the General Assemblys regular session could be seen as procedurally irregular and strategically timed to influence or undermine the regular processes and deliberations of the UN bodies.
    \n\n2. Potential for Escalation of Conflict: The involvement of the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through an advisory opinion may inadvertently escalate tensions and trigger retaliatory actions from both parties. If one party perceives the Court's decision as biased or unfavorable, it could lead to heightened rhetoric, increased militarization, and a deterioration of the security situation on the ground. Moreover, the issuance of a legal judgment may further entrench the parties in their positions, making it harder to reach a negotiated settlement and increasing the likelihood of violent confrontations. The risk of escalation underscores the need for caution and careful consideration of the potential consequences of the ICJ's involvement.
    \n\n3. Challenge of Enforcing Legal Judgments: Even if the ICJ were to issue a definitive advisory opinion on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, enforcing its judgment poses significant practical challenges. The Court lacks its own enforcement mechanism and relies on states to voluntarily comply with its decisions. However, in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where there is a long history of non-compliance with international law and UN resolutions, securing meaningful enforcement of the Court's judgment is unlikely. Without robust mechanisms for holding non-compliant parties accountable, the ICJ's advisory opinion may remain symbolic rather than effectual in bringing about tangible changes on the ground.
    \n\n4. Potential for Legalization of Occupation: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the legality of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may inadvertently legitimize Israel's ongoing occupation and annexation of Palestinian land. By focusing narrowly on the legality of specific actions such as the construction of the wall, the Court's decision may fail to address the broader context of occupation and the rights of Palestinians under international law. This risks perpetuating the status quo of occupation and settlement expansion and undermines efforts to achieve a just and sustainable resolution to the conflict based on the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity.
    \n\n5. Implications for International Relations: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has broader implications for international relations and the rule-based international order. If the Court's decision is perceived as biased or politically motivated, it could undermine trust in international legal institutions and weaken the credibility of international law as a mechanism for resolving conflicts. This could have ripple effects beyond the Israeli-Palestinian context, affecting global efforts to promote peace, security, and human rights. The ICJ must therefore uphold the principles of impartiality, independence, and integrity in its decision-making process to maintain the legitimacy of international law.
    \n\n6. Risk of Legalizing Unilateral Border Changes: An advisory opinion from the ICJ on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may set a dangerous precedent by legitimizing unilateral border changes and territorial annexations in violation of international law. If the Court were to endorse Israel's actions or provide legal justification for the construction of the wall, it could encourage other states to pursue similar unilateral measures in their own territorial disputes. This risks undermining the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the peaceful settlement of disputes enshrined in the UN Charter and international law, leading to increased instability and conflict globally.
    \n\n7. Impact on Human Rights and Civil Liberties: The construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has significant implications for human rights and civil liberties, including the rights to freedom of movement, access to education, healthcare, and livelihoods. An advisory opinion from the ICJ must carefully consider the human rights dimensions of the issue and ensure that its decision upholds the principles of dignity, equality, and non-discrimination for all affected populations. Failing to prioritize human rights in its judgment risks legitimizing violations of fundamental rights and eroding the protections afforded by international human rights law.
    \n\n8. Need for Comprehensive Conflict Resolution: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying root causes and grievances of all parties involved. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions can contribute to clarifying legal principles and norms, they are not a substitute for inclusive political dialogue, negotiation, and reconciliation. The ICJ's involvement should be part of a broader peacebuilding strategy that prioritizes dialogue, mutual understanding, and compromise to achieve a just and sustainable resolution to the conflict. By addressing the socio-economic, political, and security dimensions of the conflict holistically, stakeholders can work towards building a future based on peace, justice, and dignity for all."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Precedent of Non-Interference: Historically, both the General Assembly and the Security Council have interpreted Article 12 to mean that the Assembly should not make recommendations on matters actively handled by the Council. Deviating from this precedent could set a problematic standard, encouraging future overreach and undermining the Council's primary role in maintaining international peace and security.
    \n\n2. Impact on International Peace and Security: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has broader implications for international peace and security beyond the immediate region. Instability in the Middle East can have ripple effects on global security, including the risk of terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and disruption of energy supplies. Therefore, the ICJ's involvement in providing an advisory opinion on the conflict is not only relevant to the parties directly involved but also to the international community as a whole. A thorough examination of the legal issues by the ICJ can contribute to a better understanding of the conflict's implications for international peace and security and inform global efforts to prevent conflict escalation and promote stability in the region.
    \n\n3. Risk of Undermining Diplomatic Efforts: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ may undermine ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through negotiation and dialogue. Diplomatic negotiations require all parties to engage in good faith and demonstrate a willingness to compromise and find mutually acceptable solutions. However, resorting to legal mechanisms such as the ICJ may be perceived as a unilateral or confrontational approach that bypasses diplomatic channels. This could erode trust between the parties and hinder prospects for meaningful dialogue and conflict resolution. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the potential impact of the ICJ's involvement on diplomatic efforts and the overall peace process.
    \n\n4. Complexities of Territorial Disputes: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves complex territorial disputes over land, borders, and sovereignty, which cannot be easily resolved through legal rulings alone. Territorial disputes are inherently political and require a nuanced understanding of historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that shape competing claims. While the ICJ can provide legal interpretations, it may not have the capacity to address the underlying political complexities and power dynamics that underpin the conflict. Therefore, any advisory opinion must be considered within the broader context of the conflict and complemented by political negotiations aimed at finding mutually acceptable solutions to territorial disputes.
    \n\n5. Potential for Legal Precedent in Conflict Resolution: The ICJ's advisory opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has the potential to set a legal precedent for the resolution of similar conflicts around the world. As one of the primary judicial organs of the United Nations, the ICJ's decisions carry significant weight and influence in shaping international law and norms. Therefore, the Court's interpretation of legal principles and norms in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could have far-reaching implications for other protracted conflicts facing similar legal challenges. It is essential for the ICJ to consider the broader implications of its advisory opinion and strive to provide guidance that promotes peaceful conflict resolution and upholds the principles of justice and fairness.
    \n\n6. Role of International Legal Institutions: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict raises broader questions about the role and effectiveness of international legal institutions in addressing complex political disputes. While the ICJ serves as a forum for the peaceful settlement of disputes between states, its ability to resolve deeply entrenched conflicts involving non-state actors and asymmetrical power dynamics is limited. Therefore, while seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ may be a step towards seeking legal clarity, it should be accompanied by broader efforts to address the underlying political, social, and economic drivers of the conflict. International legal institutions must adapt to the evolving nature of conflicts and explore innovative approaches to complement traditional legal mechanisms with conflict resolution strategies that prioritize inclusivity, dialogue, and reconciliation."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Potential Bias and Political Influence: The advisory opinion request was heavily influenced by political motivations, particularly from the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement. This political context might compromise the impartiality expected of the ICJ, as the court could be seen as a tool for political maneuvering rather than an impartial judicial body providing legal clarity. In summary, these arguments challenge the ICJ's jurisdiction to provide the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly, emphasizing the potential overreach of the General Assembly, the procedural and legal constraints imposed by the UN Charter, and the potential political influences undermining the process.
    \n\n2. Potential for Polarization and Divisiveness: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through an advisory opinion has the potential to deepen existing divisions and polarize international opinion. Given the highly contentious nature of the conflict, any legal ruling is likely to be perceived differently by various stakeholders, leading to further polarization and entrenchment of positions. Moreover, the politicization of legal issues may exacerbate tensions between states and undermine prospects for constructive dialogue and cooperation. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the potential for the ICJ's involvement to exacerbate rather than alleviate divisions and seek alternative approaches to foster reconciliation and understanding among conflicting parties.
    \n\n3. Challenges of Implementing Legal Recommendations: Even if the ICJ were to issue a comprehensive advisory opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, implementing its recommendations would pose significant challenges. The resolution of complex political disputes requires more than legal judgments; it necessitates political will, cooperation, and practical measures to address underlying grievances and build trust between the parties. Furthermore, enforcing legal recommendations in a context marked by distrust, insecurity, and competing narratives is inherently challenging and may require sustained international engagement and support. Therefore, while legal opinions can provide valuable guidance, they should be complemented by comprehensive strategies for implementation and follow-up to ensure their effectiveness in promoting peace and stability.
    \n\n4. Potential for Unintended Consequences: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ carries the risk of unintended consequences that may exacerbate rather than mitigate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Legal rulings, even when well-intentioned, can have unforeseen effects on the ground and may fuel resentment, grievances, and escalatory dynamics. Moreover, legal decisions may be exploited by extremist groups or hardline elements to justify acts of violence or resistance, further complicating efforts to de-escalate tensions and promote reconciliation. Therefore, decision-makers must carefully weigh the potential consequences of involving the ICJ and consider alternative approaches that minimize the risk of unintended escalation and foster constructive engagement between the parties.
    \n\n5. Need for Contextual Understanding: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a nuanced understanding of its historical, political, and socio-economic context, which may not be fully captured by legal analyses alone. Legal opinions, while important for clarifying legal principles and norms, must be contextualized within the broader realities of the conflict and take into account the lived experiences of affected populations. Moreover, legalistic approaches may overlook the complex interplay of factors driving the conflict, including identity, nationalism, and socioeconomic disparities, which require holistic solutions that address root causes and promote reconciliation. Therefore, any involvement of the ICJ should be accompanied by efforts to enhance contextual understanding and engage with diverse perspectives to inform more effective conflict resolution strategies.
    \n\n6. Role of Civil Society and Grassroots Initiatives: Sustainable peace and reconciliation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict require the active involvement of civil society organizations, grassroots initiatives, and local communities. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions can contribute to conflict resolution, they should be complemented by bottom-up approaches that empower communities, promote dialogue, and foster mutual understanding. Civil society actors play a crucial role in building trust, bridging divides, and advocating for inclusive and participatory peace processes that address the needs and aspirations of all stakeholders. Therefore, decision-makers should recognize the importance of civil society engagement and support initiatives that amplify the voices of affected communities and promote people-centered approaches to conflict resolution."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Advisory Opinion as a Form of Judicial Overreach: The request for an advisory opinion could be seen as an attempt to use the ICJ to address a highly contentious political issue, rather than a purely legal one. This use of the ICJ for what is essentially a political matter might exceed the court's intended role, turning it into a platform for political disputes rather than judicial resolution.
    \n\n2. Potential for Legalization of Political Disputes: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may contribute to the broader trend of legalizing inherently political disputes. While legal mechanisms play a vital role in upholding international law and norms, relying excessively on legal avenues to address complex political conflicts can sideline broader political negotiations and dialogue processes. Legalization of political disputes may shift focus away from addressing underlying grievances and power imbalances, reducing the incentive for parties to engage in meaningful dialogue and compromise. Therefore, decision-makers should exercise caution to ensure that legal mechanisms complement, rather than supplant, political efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
    \n\n3. Implications for Sovereignty and Self-Determination: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict raises important questions about sovereignty and self-determination. Both Israelis and Palestinians assert their rights to self-determination and control over their respective territories, which may be impacted by legal rulings on issues such as borders, settlements, and resource allocation. Moreover, external involvement in defining the legal status of disputed territories may have implications for the sovereignty of both parties and their ability to pursue independent political futures. Therefore, any decision to involve the ICJ must be made with careful consideration of its implications for the sovereignty and self-determination of the parties involved.
    \n\n4. Long-Term Legitimacy of Legal Decisions: The long-term legitimacy of legal decisions, including advisory opinions from the ICJ, depends on their acceptance and implementation by the parties involved in the conflict. While legal rulings may provide clarity on specific legal questions, their effectiveness ultimately hinges on the willingness of states and non-state actors to abide by them. Therefore, decision-makers should assess the potential for legal decisions to be accepted and respected by all parties, taking into account factors such as trust, credibility, and the perceived fairness of the legal process. Building consensus around legal decisions may require sustained efforts to engage with stakeholders, address grievances, and build confidence in the legitimacy of the legal framework.
    \n\n5. Complexity of Transitional Justice Processes: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves addressing complex issues of transitional justice, including accountability for past atrocities, reconciliation, and reparations for victims. While legal mechanisms such as the ICJ can contribute to transitional justice processes, they must be part of a broader framework that includes truth-telling, memorialization, and institutional reform. Transitional justice requires a delicate balance between accountability and reconciliation, recognizing the need to hold perpetrators accountable while also promoting healing and social cohesion. Therefore, decision-makers should consider how legal mechanisms can be integrated into comprehensive transitional justice strategies that address the needs and rights of all affected parties.
    \n\n6. Role of Regional and International Actors: Regional and international actors play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and influencing potential avenues for conflict resolution. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions from the ICJ provide one avenue for addressing legal questions, they must be complemented by broader diplomatic efforts involving key stakeholders in the region and the international community. Regional actors, including neighboring states and regional organizations, can contribute to peacebuilding efforts by facilitating dialogue, offering mediation services, and providing political and economic support for conflict resolution initiatives. Likewise, international actors, including the United Nations, major powers, and multilateral organizations, have a responsibility to support efforts to address the root causes of the conflict and promote a just and lasting peace. Therefore, any decision to involve the ICJ should be part of a coordinated strategy that mobilizes regional and international actors to support comprehensive peacebuilding efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian context."

By highlighting violations of human rights and humanitarian law, the ICJ can draw attention to the plight of vulnerable populations, advocate for accountability for perpetrators, and promote measures to alleviate human suffering and address the root causes of conflict.
    \n\n6Facilitation of Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Processes: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can facilitate transitional justice and reconciliation processes by addressing past injustices, promoting accountability, and laying the groundwork for healing and reconciliation. The ICJ's advisory opinion can contribute to truth-telling efforts, memorialization initiatives, and reparations programs aimed at acknowledging the suffering of victims, holding perpetrators accountable, and fostering societal healing and reconciliation. By providing legal clarity on contested issues such as territorial disputes, settlements, and the status of refugees, the ICJ can help create a shared understanding of the past and build a foundation for a more just and inclusive future for all parties involved in the conflict."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Lack of Consensus and Universal Agreement: The advisory opinion process is typically invoked when there is a degree of consensus or at least broad international agreement on the need for legal clarity. In this case, the divisiveness of the issue, highlighted by the split votes and vetoes in the Security Council, indicates a lack of international consensus. This lack of consensus undermines the appropriateness of seeking an advisory opinion, as it suggests the opinion would not be universally accepted or respected.
    \n\n2. Prevention of Escalation and Violence: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can help prevent further escalation of violence and hostilities by providing a peaceful avenue for resolving disputes. Legal mechanisms offer a non-violent alternative to armed conflict, allowing parties to address grievances and seek redress through legal processes rather than resorting to force. By submitting legal questions to the ICJ, parties demonstrate their commitment to resolving differences through dialogue and legal means, reducing the risk of conflict escalation and promoting stability in the region. Furthermore, adherence to legal rulings from the ICJ can help de-escalate tensions, build confidence between parties, and create opportunities for peaceful coexistence and cooperation.
    \n\n3. Promotion of Regional Stability and Security: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict contributes to the promotion of regional stability and security by addressing underlying sources of tension and conflict in the Middle East.

Undermining the Role of Negotiation and Diplomacy: By seeking an advisory opinion, the General Assembly might be seen as circumventing the need for direct negotiations and diplomacy between the parties involved. The ICJ's involvement could disincentivize diplomatic efforts, as parties might prefer to rely on judicial pronouncements rather than engage in the challenging process of negotiation and compromise.
    \n\n2. Promotion of Legal Certainty and Predictability: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict promotes legal certainty and predictability by providing authoritative interpretations of international law. Legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions offer clarity on complex legal questions, helping to resolve ambiguities and inconsistencies in the application of international legal norms.

    "texto": "\n\n1. Potential for Non-Compliance and Further Conflict: Given the highly contentious nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there is a significant risk that any advisory opinion issued by the ICJ would not be adhered to by one or more parties. Non-compliance with the Courts opinion could exacerbate tensions and lead to further conflict, undermining the goal of achieving peace and security.
    \n\n2. Security and Self-Defense:Israel argues that the construction of the wall and its associated regime in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, is necessary for its security and self-defense. The region has experienced significant security threats, including terrorist attacks and armed incursions, which have resulted in loss of life and property. The wall serves as a defensive measure to prevent unauthorized entry of individuals and weapons into Israeli territory, thereby safeguarding the lives and security of Israeli citizens. Under international law, states have the inherent right to self-defense, and Israel asserts that the construction of the wall is a legitimate exercise of this right in response to ongoing security challenges and threats posed by armed groups operating in the region.
    \n\n3. Protection of Civilian Population:Israel maintains that the construction of the wall is aimed at protecting its civilian population from attacks and violence perpetrated by militant groups operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The wall serves as a barrier to prevent infiltration by terrorists and armed militants who seek to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians, infrastructure, and communities. By deterring such attacks, the wall contributes to the protection of the fundamental rights and safety of Israeli civilians, including their right to life and security, which are enshrined in international human rights law. Israel emphasizes that the primary purpose of the wall is to ensure the security and well-being of its civilian population, in accordance with its obligations under international law to protect the rights of individuals within its jurisdiction.
    \n\n4. Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty:Israel asserts its sovereign right to protect and control its territory, including the areas where the wall is being constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The wall is built within areas under Israeli jurisdiction or control, and Israel maintains that it has the authority to implement measures necessary for the preservation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. The construction of the wall does not alter the legal status of the territory in question, as Israel retains ultimate sovereignty over these areas pending a final resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through negotiation and mutual agreement. Israel argues that the wall is a legitimate means of exercising its territorial control and ensuring the effective administration of the areas under its authority, consistent with the principles of sovereignty and self-determination recognized under international law.
    \n\n5. Counterterrorism and Law Enforcement:Israel contends that the construction of the wall is part of its broader counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts aimed at combating terrorist activities and maintaining public order and security in the region. The wall serves as a critical tool for law enforcement agencies to prevent illegal border crossings, smuggling of weapons, and other illicit activities that pose a threat to national security and public safety. By establishing secure borders and checkpoints, the wall enables Israeli authorities to monitor and control movement in and out of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, thereby disrupting terrorist networks and preventing attacks on civilian targets. Israel emphasizes its commitment to upholding the rule of law and international humanitarian principles in its counterterrorism operations, including efforts to minimize civilian casualties and mitigate the impact of security measures on the civilian population."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Impact on ICJ's Credibility and Legitimacy: The involvement of the ICJ in such a politically charged issue could impact its credibility and perceived impartiality. If the advisory opinion is seen as biased or influenced by political considerations, it could damage the Courts reputation as a neutral arbiter of international law and weaken its authority in future cases.
    \n\n2. Prevention of Illegal Immigration and Criminal Activities: Israel argues that the construction of the wall is essential for preventing illegal immigration and criminal activities, such as human trafficking, drug smuggling, and organized crime, from infiltrating its territory. The wall acts as a physical barrier to unauthorized entry, deterring individuals seeking to enter Israel without proper documentation or clearance. By controlling access to its territory, Israel aims to maintain law and order, protect its borders, and prevent the exploitation of vulnerable populations by criminal networks. The wall's construction is therefore justified as a measure to uphold national security, sovereignty, and the rule of law, in line with Israel's obligations under international law to combat transnational crime and safeguard its borders from external threats.
    \n\n3. Preservation of Public Infrastructure and Essential Services: Israel asserts that the construction of the wall is necessary for preserving public infrastructure and essential services in areas under its control, including in and around East Jerusalem. The wall serves as a means of protecting vital infrastructure, such as roads, utilities, and communication networks, from sabotage, vandalism, and attacks by militant groups. By securing these critical assets, Israel ensures the continued provision of essential services to residents and communities within its jurisdiction, including both Israeli citizens and Palestinian residents. The wall's construction therefore contributes to the maintenance of public order, economic stability, and the functioning of essential services, which are essential components of statehood and governance under international law.
    \n\n4. Protection of Cultural and Historical Sites: Israel maintains that the construction of the wall is carried out with due regard for the protection of cultural and historical sites located in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Special provisions and safeguards are implemented to minimize the impact of the wall on significant cultural heritage sites, archaeological artifacts, and religious monuments of historical importance. Israel acknowledges the cultural and religious significance of these sites to both Palestinians and Israelis and takes measures to ensure their preservation and access, in accordance with its obligations under international law to protect cultural heritage and respect religious freedoms. The wall's construction is therefore conducted in a manner that balances security concerns with the need to safeguard cultural and historical heritage, promoting mutual respect and understanding between diverse communities in the region.
    \n\n5. Facilitation of Negotiations and Diplomatic Resolution: Israel argues that the construction of the wall, while serving immediate security needs, does not preclude the possibility of negotiated solutions and diplomatic resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The wall is not intended as a permanent or definitive boundary but rather as a temporary security measure in response to specific security threats and challenges facing Israel. Israel remains committed to pursuing negotiations and diplomatic dialogue with the Palestinian Authority and other stakeholders to address the underlying causes of the conflict, including issues related to borders, settlements, and the status of Jerusalem. The wall's construction is therefore viewed as a pragmatic and necessary step to protect Israeli citizens while simultaneously creating conditions conducive to meaningful negotiations and a durable peace settlement based on mutual recognition, security, and coexistence."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Precedent of Selective Engagement: The decision to issue an advisory opinion in this case might set a precedent for selective engagement by the ICJ, where it becomes involved in some politically sensitive issues while avoiding others. This selective engagement could be viewed as inconsistent and undermine the principle of equal application of international law.
    \n\n2. Protection of Border Communities and Residents: Israel emphasizes that the construction of the wall is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of communities located along the borders of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Border communities are often vulnerable to attacks and infiltration by armed groups, posing a direct threat to the lives and well-being of residents. The wall acts as a physical barrier to mitigate these security risks, providing a sense of security and protection for residents living in close proximity to conflict zones. By enhancing border security measures, Israel aims to safeguard the rights and livelihoods of its citizens and residents, including those from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, who have the right to live in peace and security under international law.
    \n\n3. Compliance with Domestic Legal Framework: Israel asserts that the construction of the wall is carried out in accordance with its domestic legal framework and regulatory requirements. The decision to build the wall is based on thorough assessments of security risks, strategic considerations, and consultation with relevant governmental authorities and legal experts. Israel's domestic laws and regulations governing security measures and infrastructure development provide the legal basis for implementing the wall construction project, ensuring transparency, accountability, and adherence to due process. Any legal challenges or disputes related to the construction of the wall are subject to review and adjudication by domestic courts, which uphold the rule of law and protect the rights of affected individuals and communities. Israel's commitment to respecting domestic legal norms and procedures reinforces the legitimacy and legality of the wall construction project under national law.
    \n\n4. Prevention of Smuggling and Illicit Trade: Israel highlights the role of the wall in preventing smuggling and illicit trade activities that pose a threat to national security and public safety. The porous borders of the Occupied Palestinian Territory have been exploited by criminal networks to smuggle weapons, contraband goods, and illicit substances into Israeli territory, fueling violence and instability. The construction of the wall disrupts these illicit supply chains, intercepting smuggling routes and deterring criminal organizations from engaging in illegal activities. By reducing the flow of illicit goods and materials across borders, the wall contributes to the promotion of law and order, the prevention of organized crime, and the protection of public health and safety. Israel's efforts to combat smuggling and illicit trade align with its obligations under international law to uphold border security and prevent transnational crime.
    \n\n5. Preservation of Public Order and Stability: Israel argues that the construction of the wall is essential for preserving public order and stability in the region, particularly in areas affected by conflict and political tensions. The wall serves as a stabilizing force by establishing clear boundaries and demarcating areas under Israeli jurisdiction, thereby reducing the potential for disputes, confrontations, and escalations of violence. By delineating territorial boundaries and controlling access points, the wall enhances the effectiveness of law enforcement operations, border management, and emergency response measures. This contributes to the maintenance of public order, the protection of civilian populations, and the prevention of humanitarian crises in conflict-affected areas. Israel's efforts to promote public order and stability through the construction of the wall reflect its commitment to upholding peace and security in accordance with international legal principles and humanitarian standards."

Strained Relations Between UN Organs: The General Assemblys request for an advisory opinion could strain relations between the different organs of the United Nations, particularly if it is perceived as undermining the authority of the Security Council. Such inter-organ conflict could lead to a dysfunctional UN system, reducing its overall effectiveness in maintaining international peace and security.
    \n\n2. Mitigation of Environmental Degradation: Israel emphasizes its commitment to mitigating environmental degradation and minimizing the ecological impact of the wall construction in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Environmental assessments and sustainability considerations are integrated into the planning and implementation processes to ensure responsible environmental stewardship. Measures such as erosion control, habitat restoration, and wildlife protection are implemented to minimize disruption to natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Israel also invests in green infrastructure and renewable energy solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of the wall and promote sustainable development practices. By prioritizing environmental conservation and sustainability, Israel seeks to uphold its obligations under international environmental law and contribute to the long-term health and resilience of the region's ecosystems.
    \n\n3. Protection of Minority Rights and Freedoms: Israel underscores its commitment to protecting the rights and freedoms of minority populations residing in the areas affected by the wall construction, including Palestinian communities and individuals. Special provisions and safeguards are implemented to ensure that the rights of minorities, including their cultural, linguistic, and religious rights, are respected and upheld throughout the construction process. Israel provides opportunities for meaningful participation and consultation with minority stakeholders, allowing them to voice their concerns, contribute to decision-making processes, and access essential services and resources. Efforts are made to promote social inclusion, diversity, and equality, fostering peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural groups. Israel's commitment to safeguarding minority rights aligns with its obligations under international human rights law to protect the rights of all individuals within its jurisdiction, irrespective of their background or identity.
    \n\n4. Promotion of Economic Development and Prosperity: Israel highlights the potential economic benefits and opportunities associated with the construction of the wall, including job creation, infrastructure development, and investment promotion. The wall construction project generates employment opportunities for local communities, including both Israeli and Palestinian workers, thereby stimulating economic growth and poverty reduction in the region. Infrastructure improvements, such as road networks, transportation hubs, and border crossings, facilitate trade, commerce, and connectivity, fostering economic integration and regional cooperation. Israel also promotes public-private partnerships and entrepreneurship initiatives to spur innovation, productivity, and competitiveness in sectors related to security, construction, and technology. By investing in economic development and prosperity, Israel aims to enhance the quality of life, promote social stability, and build resilience against economic shocks and external threats. These efforts contribute to the overall well-being and prosperity of communities affected by the wall construction, fostering sustainable development and shared prosperity in the region.
    \n\n5. Humanitarian Assistance and Crisis Response: Israel underscores its commitment to providing humanitarian assistance and crisis response measures to communities affected by conflict and instability in the areas surrounding the wall construction. Humanitarian aid is delivered to vulnerable populations, including displaced persons, refugees, and marginalized groups, to meet their basic needs and alleviate suffering. Israel collaborates with international humanitarian organizations, non-governmental organizations, and donor partners to coordinate relief efforts, deliver emergency supplies, and provide essential services such as healthcare, shelter, and clean water. Special attention is given to protecting the rights and dignity of vulnerable individuals, including women, children, and persons with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected by conflict-related violence and displacement. Israel's humanitarian assistance efforts reflect its commitment to upholding humanitarian principles, promoting human dignity, and alleviating the suffering of civilians affected by armed conflict and humanitarian crises."

    "texto": "Potential for Partiality Perception: Given the highly politicized nature of the conflict, any advisory opinion issued by the ICJ might be perceived as partial or biased, regardless of its legal soundness. This perception could damage the Courts reputation for impartiality and fairness.
    Protection of Educational Opportunities: Israel asserts that the construction of the wall aims to safeguard educational opportunities for children and youth residing in the affected areas. By enhancing security and stability, the wall creates a safer environment conducive to learning and academic development. Schools and educational institutions located near conflict zones are protected from security threats, ensuring that students have access to quality education without fear of violence or disruption. Israel also invests in educational infrastructure, including the construction of new schools, renovation of existing facilities, and provision of educational resources and support services. These efforts promote educational equity, inclusivity, and access to learning opportunities for all children, regardless of their background or circumstances. Israel recognizes the importance of education as a fundamental human right and a key driver of social progress, economic development, and peacebuilding, and prioritizes initiatives to support the educational needs of vulnerable populations affected by conflict and insecurity.
    Preservation of Religious Sites and Freedom of Worship: Israel emphasizes its commitment to preserving religious sites and protecting freedom of worship for all religious communities residing in the areas affected by the wall construction. Special measures are implemented to safeguard sacred sites, religious monuments, and places of worship, ensuring that individuals can practice their faith and perform religious rituals without interference or intimidation. Israel facilitates access to religious sites for worshippers of diverse religious backgrounds, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, and members of other faith traditions, allowing them to observe religious holidays, ceremonies, and pilgrimages in accordance with their beliefs. Interfaith dialogue and cooperation initiatives are promoted to foster mutual respect, understanding, and tolerance among religious communities, promoting peaceful coexistence and social harmony. Israel's commitment to protecting religious freedom and cultural heritage aligns with its obligations under international human rights law to uphold the rights of individuals to freedom of religion and belief, irrespective of their faith or creed.
    Enhancement of Border Security and Counterterrorism Measures: Israel highlights the importance of the wall construction in enhancing border security and strengthening counterterrorism measures to prevent attacks and protect civilians from extremist threats. The wall serves as a critical line of defense against infiltration by terrorist groups, armed militants, and violent extremists seeking to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians and infrastructure. By fortifying border defenses, implementing advanced surveillance technologies, and deploying security forces, Israel effectively detects and neutralizes security threats, thwarting potential terrorist plots and saving lives. The wall construction project complements broader counterterrorism efforts, including intelligence gathering, law enforcement cooperation, and international collaboration, aimed at disrupting terrorist networks, dismantling extremist cells, and combating radicalization and violent extremism. Israel's commitment to enhancing border security and counterterrorism measures reflects its determination to safeguard national security, protect innocent civilians, and uphold the rule of law in the face of persistent security challenges and threats posed by terrorism and extremism.
    Promotion of Regional Stability and Conflict Resolution: Israel emphasizes its role in promoting regional stability and advancing conflict resolution efforts through the construction of the wall. By enhancing security and reducing the risk of violence and conflict along its borders, the wall contributes to a more stable and secure environment conducive to diplomatic dialogue, peace negotiations, and confidence-building measures between Israel and its neighbors. Israel's commitment to conflict resolution is demonstrated through its support for peace initiatives, regional cooperation frameworks, and bilateral negotiations aimed at resolving longstanding conflicts and addressing shared security concerns. The wall construction project is part of broader efforts to create conditions for peaceful coexistence, mutual trust, and reconciliation among neighboring states, fostering a climate of stability, prosperity, and cooperation in the region. Israel remains committed to pursuing peaceful solutions to regional conflicts and engaging constructively with its neighbors to build a future based on mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation."

    "texto": "I will present Palestines arguments on jurisdiction and admissibility. I can, and will, be succinct, as there is no doubt that the Court has jurisdiction to give the requested opinion and that there are no compelling reasons for the Court to decline to issue the requested opinion. /n/nMr President, the Court clearly has jurisdiction to provide the requested opinion. The General Assembly is obviously competent to request the opinion in line with Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter. Moreover, resolution 77/247 was adopted by a clear majority and in full compliance with both the requirements of the Charter and the Assemblys Rules of Procedure./n/nThe questions posed by the General Assembly are also plainly legal in character. As the Court has repeatedly and consistently confirmed in its jurisprudence, the fact that the questions may have political implications is irrelevant and does not bar the Court from fulfilling its essential judicial function. /n/nSecond, the function of this Court, of these judges, of you, is to state the law: to spell out the legal rights and obligations that will allow a just solution in the future, in conformity with international law. The political context is totally irrelevant. The legal questions in Namibia, in the Wall case, in the Chagos case, all had a political context, but the Court did not blink. It has never shied away from drawing the consequences of the right to self-determination. In Chagos and in Namibia, the Advisory Opinions have been significant and positive in their outcomes and effects. By identifying the applicable legal principles, and then applying them to the facts, the Court performs a most significant, uniquely significant role, for protagonists and for the international community as a whole. With great respect to my friends from the United States and Britain, it is the very opposite of what they have written: the function of this Court, in interpreting and applying the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, can only assist in a solution based on the law, by setting out the parameters required by the law to resolve the matter. A forthright advisory opinion from this Court makes a resolution more likely, not less likely."

      "texto": "Second, the questions concern the United Nations continuous responsibility for resolving the question of Palestine. This responsibility stems from its duties relating to matters of international peace and security arising under the Charter, and as the Court put it, “has its origin in the Mandate and the Partition Resolution concerning Palestine”. This responsibility continues, as confirmed by the unequivocal and contemporary practice of the General Assembly, the Security Council, as well as other United Nations organs and bodies. /n/nSome of these submissions oppose the advisory opinion because of the purported existence of a “negotiation framework” or of bilateral “negotiations”. However, none of these considerations constitutes a reasonable basis for the Court to refuse the General Assemblys request. To the contrary, an opinion from the Court will assist in these negotiations by confirming the applicable international legal framework, as affirmed in United Nations resolutions, in order to reach a just and peaceful solution. /n/nThe Courts opinion can thus only contribute to achieving the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine called for by the Security Council. It  your opinion  will clarify the legal rights and obligations of Israel, of Palestine, of third States and of the United Nations to be reflected in a settlement that is truly consistent with international law. Thus, the Courts opinion will also contribute to upholding the international rule of law at large. /n/nThird, the General Assembly, when deciding upon the request for the current advisory opinion, was acutely aware of the claim that such request would somehow purportedly undermine the chances of future negotiations. Nevertheless, the General Assembly decided to ask for the Courts legal determination anyway. The General Assembly thus found that this argument had no merit. To the contrary, the General Assembly considered that the Courts opinion would be helpful as to future steps to be taken by the political organs of the United Nations, as well as by all States. In line with your role as one of the principal organs of the organization, as envisaged in Article 7 of the Charter, the Court ought not now set aside this considered decision of the General Assembly. /n/nRather, Palestine invites the Court to fulfil its duty of providing its legal determination to the General Assembly by answering the legal questions put to it. In so doing, you will assist all States, as well as the United Nations, in furthering respect for the international rule of law, the fulfilment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, and a just and peaceful solution in accordance with international law. /n/nFor all the above reasons, the State of Palestine requests the Court to declare that Israels discriminatory practices against the Palestinian people are tantamount to apartheid, which this Court defined in its 1971 Advisory Opinion on Namibia as “distinctions, exclusions, restrictions and limitations exclusively based on grounds of race, colour or descent or national or ethnic origin, which constitute a denial of fundamental human rights”. This actually reflects the Palestinian reality."

      "texto": "I stand before you as 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, half of them children, are besieged and bombed, killed and maimed, starved and displaced. As more than 3.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are subjected to the colonization of their territory and the racist violence that enables it. As 1.7 million Palestinians in Israel are treated as second-class citizens, as unwelcomed intruders in their ancestral land. As 7 million Palestine refugees continue to be denied their right to return to their land and homes. I stand before you as the entire Palestinian people continue to be denied their fundamental rights, their very existence negated. /n/nThe United Nations enshrined in its Charter the right of all peoples to self-determination and pledged to rid the world of the gravest breaches of this right, namely colonialism and apartheid. Yet, for decades, the Palestinian people have been denied this right and have endured both colonialism and apartheid. There are those who are outraged by the use of these words. They should instead be outraged by the reality we are living. This reality is known by every Palestinian, suffered by millions, generation after generation./n/nIt is a reality where Israel can destroy Gaza, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians, almost half of them children, leaving 1 million children starved, terrorized and traumatized for life, orphaned of a mother, a father, or both, amputated and disabled, leaving nearly 2 million people displaced and desperate, with nowhere to shelter from the onslaught. The genocide underway in Gaza is the result of decades of impunity and inaction. Ending Israels impunity is a moral, political and legal imperative. /n/nI thus implore you, as you hear the legal arguments, not to forget the Palestinian people. Not to forget that our people are struggling every day for their survival as individuals, families, communities, as a nation. That less than a month ago, this Court ordered provisional measures in a landmark case brought by the Republic of South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention  an Order that Israel continues to defy with impunity. /n/nFor decades Israel has occupied the Palestinian territory, committing violations that are inherent to its presence in our land and colonial objective. This occupation is annexationist and supremacist in nature. It is a deliberate, cynical perversion of international law. It is thus illegal. The only solution consistent with international law is for this illegal occupation to come to an immediate, unconditional, and total end. /n/nIn 1967, Israel then occupied the remainder of Palestine. And from the first day of its occupation, started colonizing and annexing the land with the aim of making its occupation irreversible. It left us with a collection of disconnected Bantustans preventing the independence of our State, as shown in map 4. Israel wanted the geography of Palestine, but not its demography. So it kept pushing our people out: out of their homes, out of their land. /n/nHere is the fifth map. It was displayed by Israels Prime Minister to the General Assembly last September. He called this “the New Middle East”. There is no Palestine at all on this map, only Israel, comprised of all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. This shows you what the prolonged, continuous Israeli occupation of Palestine is intended to accomplish: the complete disappearance of Palestine and the destruction of the Palestinian people. /n/nIt has taken the Palestinian people decades of painful struggle to stand before you today. We appeal to the Court to uphold our rights to self-determination, return and all other human rights, including by declaring that the Israeli occupation is illegal and must end immediately, totally and unconditionally. /n/nFirst, the questions concern serious breaches of jus cogens and erga omnes norms. As my colleagues will show, those breaches, by Israel, include violations of:  the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force,  the prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid,  the denial of the right of self-determination,  as well as other egregious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law of the same character. /n/nFirst, Israel has repeatedly refused, to this very day, to engage in meaningful negotiations with Palestine on the basis of international law and United Nations resolutions. This is reflected in repeated statements, including, most recently, by the Israeli Prime Minister and other high-ranking Israeli officials. The mere hypothetical possibility of future negotiations cannot thus be used as a mere pretext for avoiding the application of international law to this crucial matter, or for avoiding responsibility for ongoing breaches of peremptory norms of international law. /n/nI will address the legality of Israels prolonged occupation, annexation and settlement of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In so doing, I will identify the elements that determine whether, and in what circumstances, a belligerent occupation is, or becomes, unlawful under international law; I will then review the evidence to assess whether those elements are present here; and I will show that, based on the applicable law and the well-established and undisputed facts, Israels 56-year occupation of Palestinian territory is manifestly and gravely unlawful, and that international law requires that it be brought to an end, completely and unconditionally. /n/nThe applicable rule of law is straightforward. As Pictet wrote in 1958, “occupation . . . is essentially a temporary . . . situation”. This remains the law. In December 2022, the General Assembly, in resolution 77/126, recognized that “the occupation of a territory is to be a temporary, de facto situation, whereby the occupying Power can neither claim possession nor exert its sovereignty over the territory it occupies”. This rule is neatly explained in the Written Statement of Switzerland: “The laws of occupation are built on the idea that occupation is only a temporary situation. They are based on four fundamental principles: 1) the occupying power does not acquire sovereignty over the territory it occupies; 2) the occupying power must maintain the status quo ante and must not take any measures which might bring about permanent changes”. The law is thus crystal clear: occupation can only be a temporary state of affairs. A permanent occupation is a legal oxymoron. /n/nMr President, what makes Israels ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territory unlawful is precisely its permanent character, and what demonstrates its permanence are: (i) Israels de jure and de facto annexation of Jerusalem and the West Bank; (ii) its claims of sovereignty over these areas, which it refers to by their biblical names, Judea and Samaria, and considers integral parts of the State of Israel; (iii) its establishment of hundreds of permanent Israeli settlements, with over 700,000 Israeli settlers, who have been promised by successive Israeli governments that they will never be removed; and (iv) the multitude of official statements and documents that openly declare Israels intention to incorporate all of the occupied territory east of the Green Line into the State of Israel as a permanent part of a single Jewish State extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. /n/nAs I will show you, the evidence is overwhelming and leaves no room for serious dispute about Israels actions or its intentions. As Israels Cabinet Secretary wrote in June of last year: “Judea and Samaria were not seized from a sovereign state recognized by international law, and the State of Israel has a right to impose its sovereignty over these areas as they comprise the cradle of history of the Jewish people and are an inseparable part of the Land of Israel.” As purported legal authority, the Cabinet Secretary invoked the First Book of Maccabees, written in the year 100 BC, chapter 15, verse 33: “It is not a foreign land we have taken nor have we seized the property of foreigners, but only our ancestral heritage, which for a time had been unjustly occupied by our enemies.” /n/nThis was followed in August of last year by a message broadcast on Israels Army Radio by Israels Heritage Minister: “Sovereignty must be extended within the borders of the West Bank . . . and in the most prudent way, to create international recognition that this place is ours . . . There is no Green Line, it is a fictitious line that creates a distorted reality and must be erased.” /n/nIn September 2023, Israels Prime Minister literally erased the Green Line, in his presentation to the United Nations General Assembly. As you saw earlier, he depicted the State of Israel as extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, eliminating not only the Green Line but all traces of Palestine. This was no oversight; it was an act of the Head of Government, with all the attribution that it implies. The same message was delivered by Israels Finance Minister in Paris, six months earlier, when he denied the existence of Palestine and declared that Palestinians do not constitute a people. Previously, he said: “We are here to stay. We will make it clear that our national ambition for a Jewish State from the river to the sea is an accomplished fact, a fact not open to discussion or negotiation.” This has been Israels consistent position. Here is the map of Israel produced by its armed forces and published by the Government in 2021. One State, Israel, from the river to the sea. There is no Green Line; there is no Palestine. Instead, Palestine has been replaced by “Judea” and “Samaria”, which, according to Israels highest officials, are now integral parts of the State of Israel. /n/nAs these official statements and maps demonstrate, Israel makes no secret of its intention to retain permanently the entire area east of the Green Line. Its annexation of occupied Palestinian territory began in 1967 with legislation annexing East Jerusalem, which Israel increased eleven-fold in size to incorporate not only the Holy City but also vast areas of the West Bank surrounding the City. Its Defence Minister, Moshe Dayan, declared at the time: “The Israel Defence Forces have liberated Jerusalem . . . We have returned to this most sacred shrine, never to part from it again.” In 1990, the Israeli Cabinet instructed the Foreign Minister to notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations that “Jerusalem is not, in any part, ‘occupied territory; it is the sovereign capital of Israel”. In June 1996, the Guidelines of the incoming Israeli Government stated: “Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, is one city, whole and undivided, and will remain forever under Israels sovereignty.” More recently, in assuming office in December 2022, the current Prime Minister declared that “[t]he Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land nor occupiers in our eternal capital Jerusalem”. As these official statements make clear, Israels dominion over Jerusalem and the incorporated area of the West Bank is not intended to be temporary. It has been repeatedly proclaimed by Israels highest authorities to be “eternal”. /n/nIn furtherance of this end, more than 230,000 Israeli Jewish settlers  encouraged, subsidized and protected by the Israeli Government and occupation forces  have been installed in East Jerusalem, dramatically altering the demographic composition of the Holy City by creating an Israeli Jewish majority. /n/nIsrael has been equally clear in declaring its permanence in the West Bank, where more than 465,000 Israeli Jewish settlers have been implanted with the support of every Israeli government since 1967, in over 270 ever-expanding settlements, spread throughout this territory, in what can only be described as a vast colonial enterprise. These settlements, whose accelerated growth and distribution over the years are illustrated on your screens now, are a key instrument of Israels annexation of the West Bank; this is both their purpose and their effect. /n/nAs the Secretary-General reported to the General Assembly in 2015: “Occupation is supposed to be temporary because the annexation or acquisition of territory by force is strictly prohibited under international law . . . In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the establishment and maintenance of the settlements amount to a slow, but steady annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory.” /n/nIsrael has made no secret of the intended permanence of these settlements. In 2010, Prime Minister Netanyahu told Israeli settlers in the West Bank: “Our message is clear. ‘We are planting here, we will stay here, we will build here. This place will be an inseparable part of the State of Israel for eternity.” In August 2019, the Prime Minister announced that: “The time has come to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and to also arrange the status of all Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria . . . They will be part of the State of Israel.” In January 2020, Israels Defence Minister, Naftali Bennett, declared: “Our objective is that within a short amount of time . . . we will apply sovereignty to all of Area C, not just the settlements, not just this bloc or another.” /n/nIn December 2022, the Guiding Principles of the incoming Israeli Government declared: “The Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all parts of the Land of Israel. The Government will promote and develop the settlement of all parts of the Land of Israel  the Galilee, the Negev, the Golan and Judea and Samaria.” The coalition agreement between the political parties that formed the Government included this pledge: “[T]he Prime Minister will lead the formulation and promotion of policy in which sovereignty will be applied in Judea and Samaria, while choosing the timing and weighing all the national and international interests of the State of Israel.” /n/nGeneral Assembly resolution 77/126 was adopted on 12 December 2022, just as the current Israeli Government was assuming office. The resolution pointedly recalled: “[T]he principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force and therefore the illegality of the annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, which constitutes a breach of international law” and the resolution condemned Israels “annexation of land, whether de facto or through national legislation”. /n/nIsrael has thoroughly disregarded resolution 77/126, just as it disregarded all prior General Assembly and Security Council resolutions declaring illegal the annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the establishment of Israeli settlements there. These include but are by no means limited to:  Security Council resolution 252 of 1968, declaring Israels acquisition of territory by military conquest “inadmissible”;  resolution 476 of 1980, which “[r]eaffirm[ed] the overriding necessity for ending the prolonged occupation of Arab territories” in 1980 and “[s]trongly deplore[d] the refusal of Israel . . . to comply with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly”;  resolution 478 of 1980, which “determine[d] that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel . . . to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and in particular the ‘basic law on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith”;  resolution 2334 of 2016, which “reaffirm[ed] . . . the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force”, and condemned “all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 . . . including, inter alia, the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians”; and  at least 28 General Assembly resolutions, which expressly condemned Israels “annexation” of Jerusalem and the West Bank. /n/nIsrael has also blatantly disregarded the obligations reflected in the Courts 2004 Advisory Opinion in the Wall case. Since then, instead of dismantling the wall, Israel has extended it from a length of 190 km to more than 460 km, encompassing hundreds of additional square kilometres of Palestinian land, and incorporating it into the State of Israel. In its Advisory Opinion, the Court expressed concern lest “the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a ‘fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation”. /n/nAnd that is precisely what has happened over the past 20 years, not only within the expanded confines of the wall, but all across the West Bank, most of which has now been annexed de facto by Israel. In 2022, the report of the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry concluded: “Israel treats the occupation as a permanent fixture and has  for all intents and purposes  annexed parts of the West Bank . . . The International Court of Justice anticipated such a scenario in its 2004 advisory opinion . . . This has now become the reality.” /n/nThe Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory reached the same conclusion: “The occupation by Israel has been conducted in profound defiance of international law . . . Its 55-year-old occupation burst through the restraints of temporariness long ago. Israel has progressively engaged in the de jure and de facto annexation of occupied territory.” /n/nMr President, Israels ongoing annexation of the West Bank accelerated in 2023, with the largest ever expansion of settlements in the territory. Twenty-two new settlements were authorized and more than 16,000 new housing units were built, funded or planned by Israeli authorities. As explained by Israels Finance Minister: “The construction boom in Judea and Samaria and all over our country continues . . . We will continue to develop the settlement[s] and strengthen the Israeli hold on the territory.” /n/nIn developing its settlements, Israel has invested heavily in the infrastructure needed to supply them with water and electric power, as well as a network of roads and highways to connect them to one another and to Israel itself. These investments, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, attest to the intended permanent character of the settlements. The roads, which Palestinians are forbidden to use, and a pervasive system of roadblocks and checkpoints, prevent Palestinians but not Israeli settlers from moving from place to place in the West Bank, and they isolate Palestinian communities by cutting them off from one another. Israels settlement expansion has thus both uprooted Palestinians from their homes to make room for new settlements, and forced them to live in disconnected and non-contiguous enclaves, which the Special Rapporteur has called “a fragmented archipelago of 165 disparate patches of land”. This achieves the fundamental objective of the occupation: permanent acquisition of the maximum amount of Palestinian territory, with the minimum number of Palestinians in it. /n/nIn furtherance of this objective, and with increasing frequency, armed groups of settlers, supported by Israels occupation forces and encouraged by government ministers, have violently expelled thousands of peaceful Palestinian civilians from their ancestral villages and lands. A United Nations Fact Finding Mission confirmed: “[T]he motivation behind this violence and the intimidation against the Palestinians and their properties is to drive the local populations away from their lands and allow the settlements to expand.” The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported in March 2023: “[S]ettler violence further intensified, reaching the highest levels ever recorded by the United Nations.” In November 2023, the High Commissioner warned that the situation had further deteriorated with “a sharp increase in settler violence and takeover of land across the West Bank. Since 7 October,” he continued, “nearly 1,000 Palestinians from at least 15 herding communities have been forced from their homes”. /n/nThe Secretary-General, in his most recent report, issued on 25 October 2023, expressly linked the expansion of Israeli settlements to the permanent acquisition of Palestinian territory: “[S]uccessive Israeli Governments have consistently advanced and implemented policies of settlement expansion and takeover of Palestinian land. The policies of the current Government in this regard are aligned, to an unprecedented extent, with the goals of the Israeli settler movement to expand long-term control over the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and, in practice, to further integrate those areas within the territory of the State of Israel.” /n/nApparently, very far indeed. According to former US President Barack Obama, in the memoir he published in 2020: “[J]ust about every country in the world considered Israels continued occupation of the Palestinian territories to be a violation of international law. As a result, our diplomats found themselves in the awkward position of having to defend Israel for actions that we ourselves opposed.”70 This is exactly what the United States is doing  again  in these proceedings. /n/nStarting from the Nakba of 1948 until now, Israel has adopted discriminatory legislation and measures by which it has established a deeply entrenched system of racial discrimination against Palestinians, subjugating them to Israeli domination and denying their fundamental rights. /n/nDiscrimination against the Palestinian people is as integral to Israels prolonged occupation as is the annexation and colonization of the Palestinian territory. They are inextricable parts of the same whole and feed off each other. /n/nUsing “a toolbox of population control” and inhumane acts amounting to aggravated forms of racial discrimination, Israel restricts every aspect of Palestinian life, from birth to death, resulting in manifest human rights violations and an overt system of repression and persecution. /n/nThrough indiscriminate killing, summary execution, mass arbitrary arrest, torture, forced displacement, settler violence, movement restrictions and blockades, Israel subjects Palestinians to inhumane life conditions and untold human indignities, affecting the fate of every man, woman and child under its control. /n/nPalestinians, and Palestinians only, endure horrific levels of extensive human and material losses, including home demolitions enforced as collective punishment. All of this has created a coercive environment that facilitates Israels forcible displacement of Palestinians. /n/nAs described by the Special Rapporteur: “Collective punishment is an inflamed scar that runs across the entire Israeli occupation of Palestine. Notwithstanding numerous resolutions, reports and reminders critical of its use, Israel continues to rely upon collective punishment as a prominent instrument in its coercive toolbox of population control. The logic of collective punishment has been to project domination in order to subdue a subjugated population through inflicting a steep price for its resistance to alien rule.” /n/nApartheid exists in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Twenty participant States expressly hold the same position including victims of apartheid, South Africa and Namibia. /n/nFinally, the inhuman acts are committed with the purpose of maintaining the apartheid régime, and by it, maintaining permanently Israels illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. /n/nA one-State reality of unequal rights consolidating segregation and apartheid against Palestinians is reflected in the inherently discriminatory character of the 2018 Basic Law “Israel  The Nation-State of the Jewish People”. /n/nUnder this law, “exercising the right to national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people”. Developing Jewish settlements became an Israeli “national value”, not only in the occupied West Bank and the Syrian Golan but even in Israel, and I ask where? On which lands? The answer is on the lands where Palestinian citizens of Israel live, especially in the Galilee and the Naqab. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, in its written statement the State of Palestine explained that the right to self-determination comprises four specific components. First, the right to territorial integrity. Second, the right not to be subjected to demographic manipulation within that territory by a foreign power. Third, the right to exercise permanent sovereignty over its natural resources. And fourth, the right to be able to pursue its chosen economic, social and cultural development. The prolonged occupation, colonization and purported annexation by Israel of Palestinian territory, with all the discriminatory and other unlawful acts, have and continue to deprive the Palestinian people of each of these four distinct components. /n/nLet me start with the right to territorial integrity, so recently recognized and given effect by the Court in its Advisory Opinion on Chagos, and endorsed by an overwhelming majority by the General Assembly of the United Nations. This implements resolutions 1514 and 2625. Yet, Israel has clearly violated the territorial integrity of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, through over more than half a century of belligerent occupation. As Mr Reichler has described, it has purportedly annexed Jerusalem and the West Bank, and it has established hundreds of settlements populated by more than 700,000 settlers, regarded as a permanent part of Israel. It has extended the Wall that this Court found to be illegal in 2004. It has confined Palestinians to enclaves. It has severed Jerusalem, it has restricted Palestinian rights of entry from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It has transformed the Gaza Strip into an impoverished enclave, a besieged, bombarded community, severed from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Its leaders have declared that Israel will be sovereign over all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea and it has made this formal government policy. /n/nWhat is the consequence of this? It is the acquisition of territory by force. It is the reduction and fragmentation, as you have seen, of the territory left for the Palestinians. This is a manifest violation of Palestines territorial integrity, its unity, its contiguity, which are core elements of the right to self-determination. The General Assembly, the Security Council, the Human Rights Council have repeatedly called for the preservation of Palestines territorial integrity, and condemned Israels acts as a violation of the right of the Palestinian people to exercise their self-determination. We urge the Court to declare Israels 56-year occupation to be unlawful, to confirm, to take the words of your recent opinion in the Chagos case, that Israel is under an obligation to bring its presence on the territory of Palestine to an end and to do so as rapidly as possible. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the fourth component of the right to self-determination is the right of a people to determine its own political status and direction, and to pursue its own economic, social and cultural development of its choice. This is confirmed by a multitude of instruments and General Assembly resolutions. Yet Israel persists in prohibiting and punishing political expressions of Palestinian identity and nationhood. Flags are outlawed and attacked. Civil society organizations and political parties are declared to be unlawful. Leaders and elected representatives, and civilians more generally, including so many children, are assaulted, exiled, imprisoned or killed. /n/nGeneral Assembly resolutions and many treaties confirm that these rights exist under international law. And they have been systematically violated. The economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people are suppressed by a prolonged and unlawful occupation; by the purported annexation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem; by the settlements; by the wall and its associated régime and infrastructure; by the blockade of Gaza; by the fragmentation of land; by the deprivation of resources; by the restrictions on freedom and movement of people and of goods; and by a multitude of other acts of subjugation and collective punishment. These acts, and others, have curtailed the access of the Palestinian people to livelihoods; they have made the country and the people totally dependent on aid. /n/nIn summary, Israel has arrogated to itself the right to decide who owns Palestinian land, who may live on it, and how it is to be used. On Israels approach, it decides on the use of resources and allocation of benefits. On Israels approach, it decides whether Palestinians remain or return. On Israels approach, it decides how, if at all, Palestinians may meet, trade, teach, worship, live, love. /n/nMr President, let us be blunt: Israel has sought to negate the rights of the Palestinian people to exercise their right of self-determination, in all aspects, across all parts of the territory of Mandatory Palestine. It has done so for decades and it wishes to do so forever. Tragically, tragically, Israel celebrates the manifest violation of international law inherent in its prolonged occupation. Tragically, tragically, Israel asserts “the right of national self-determination in the state of Israel is unique to the Jewish people”, under its own 2018 Basic Law. Tragically, tragically, Israel sets its face against the role of international law. No one in this Great Hall of Justice is starry-eyed about international law, but it is what we have, and it is your role, as judges of this Court, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, to affirm the place and the power of international law, to confirm the illegality of the occupation, to make clear that Palestine — in all respects — meets the criteria of statehood under international law with all the rights and responsibilities that implies. /n/nAs we address you today, this breach has reached its most inhumane levels. More than two million Palestinians in Gaza are being pushed all the way to the border, to the very brink, Palestinian children, women and men consumed by disease, despair, destruction and death, which are spreading like wildfire. /n/nInstead, Israel started to colonize the land. /n/nInstead, Israel denied the existence of the Palestinian people."

      "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, the evidence is before you  in the written submissions of the State of Palestine and dozens of other States and international organizations, and in the voluminous materials supplied to you by the Secretary-General  and it is indisputable. Under the umbrella of its prolonged military occupation, Israel has been steadily annexing the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and it continues to do so. Its undisguised objective is the permanent acquisition of this territory, and the exercise of sovereignty over it, in defiance of the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force. /n/nThe evidence is not only indisputable, it is of the highest probative value: investigative reports of authoritative United Nations agencies; reports of the Secretary-General; resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly; legislative and administrative acts by the Israeli Government; and public statements against interest by the most senior government officials admitting that Israels objective is sovereignty over all the territory east of the Green Line and its incorporation into a single Jewish State from the river to the sea. In this case, there is no reason not to take them at their word, because their deeds have been entirely consistent with it. /n/nFor Israel, as its successive governments have made clear, there is no Palestine. It simply does not exist. In November 2023, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared that his Government would never agree to a Palestinian State in the occupied territory71. He later declared: “I will not compromise on full security control over all the territory west of Jordan  and this is contrary to a Palestinian state.”72 Israels intransigence was confirmed by its staunchest ally in December 2023, when US President Joe Biden publicly lamented that Israels leaders “dont want anything remotely approaching a two-state solution”73. /n/nThat is the very solution demanded by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the overwhelming majority of States and the State of Palestine itself. It is, in fact, the only solution that can lead to lasting peace and security for the Israeli people as well as the Palestinian people. And it is this very solution that has been frustrated by Israels defiant insistence on maintaining its dominion over Palestinian territory in perpetuity. This is why the Courts advisory opinion is so critical and so urgent. The best, and possibly the last, hope for the two-State solution that is so vital to the needs of both peoples is for the Court to declare illegal the main obstacle to that solution  the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine  and for it to pronounce, in the clearest possible terms, that international law requires that this entire illegal enterprise be terminated: completely, unconditionally and immediately. /n/nMr President, the law is clear and it demands nothing less. A permanent occupation  one that is founded upon annexation and massive settlement of the occupied territory, and which aims to exercise sovereignty over it  is manifestly and gravely unlawful; it is an ongoing international wrong that must be brought to an immediate end. As the Court ruled in 1971: “[T]he continued presence of South Africa in Namibia being illegal, South Africa is under obligation to withdraw its administration from Namibia immediately and thus put an end to its occupation of the Territory”. /n/nThe Secretary-General applied this principle directly to Palestine in his remarks to the Security Council one month ago: “Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully independent, viable and sovereign State realized, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements. Israels occupation must end.” /n/nMr President, the proverbial ball is now in your court. The General Assembly has asked you the critical questions. It is now your responsibility to answer them. Silence is not an option. As the immortal Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, wrote: “In silence we become accomplices.” But, he assured us, when we speak: “Every word has the power to change the world.” /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, your words have such power. In 2004, the Court affirmed the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. In 2024, it is time for you to enable them finally to exercise that right, by freeing them from the unlawful Israeli occupation of their territory, so that they may live in a sovereign and fully independent State of their own, in peaceful and secure coexistence with all their neighbours, including Israel. By upholding international law, which is all the State of Palestine asks you to do, your powerful words will change the world. /n/nIsraels measures, policies and practices against the Palestinian people are no less pervasive in their reach or less pernicious in their consequences than the institutionalized racial discrimination and segregation that existed in South Africa. And just like in 1971, the international community relies on this Court to play its own genuine role to bring about an end to this glaring injustice. An immediate end to this illegal situation will bestow on the Palestinian people the fundamental rights to which they are entitled by international law, yet unfortunately they have been so unjustly denied. /n/nWhat are the consequences of Israels violations of Palestines right to self-determination and its exercise? Professor Pellet is going to address these matters, so I can be brief: as the purpose and effect of the occupation is the denial of the right of self-determination, and the prevention — lets be frank — of the solution called for by the Security Council, the General Assembly and the vast majority of States of our world, premised on the existence of the two-State solution — the occupation is illegal and must be brought to an “immediate, unconditional and total” end. The right of self-determination requires that UN Member States bring Israels occupation to an immediate end. No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No contribution to forcible actions. No money, no arms, no trade, no nothing. All UN Members are obliged by law to end Israels presence on the territory of Palestine. /n/nFor 75 years, the Palestinian people have faced attempts to push them out of geography and, indeed, out of history. And it goes on. And it will go on forever, unless and until international law is upheld. Unless and until the unlawful occupation of Palestine ends. /n/nWe call on you to confirm that Israels presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal, that the presence of its occupation forces and settlers is illegal, and that its occupation must thus come to an immediate, complete and unconditional end. This occupation has served as cover for Israels colonial designs: the acquisition of Palestinian territory by force. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, based on the United Nations record, you should have no difficulty arriving at the conclusion that the occupation is prolonged, that Palestinian territory has been annexed, that our self-determination has been denied, and that the people of Palestine have been subjected to systematic racial discrimination."

      "texto": "The occupation alone has persisted for 56 years. As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, explained in 2022, “[t]he occupation by Israel has been conducted in profound defiance of international law and hundreds of United Nations resolutions, with scant pushback from the international community.” /n/nIn the Construction of a Wall case, this Court held that: “The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law . . . [and that Israel is under an obligation to] dismantle forthwith the structure therein situated, and to repeal or render ineffective forthwith all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto”. /n/nPalestinians continue to be subjected to routine violent Israeli raids on their homes  with thousands of adults and children being subjected to unlawful arbitrary arrests by Israeli soldiers, in the dead of night, and indefinitely renewable internment without trial  known euphemistically as “administrative detention”; and a dual legal system pursuant to which Palestinians  including Palestinian children  are tried under military legislation by military judges  often themselves illegal settlers, in Israeli military courts, without basic protection of international humanitarian and human rights law, while Israeli settlers living illegally in the same territory are subject to an entirely different legal régime, and tried in Israeli civilian courts with full access to due process. /n/nIsrael has occupied the Palestinian territory in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and annexed East Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank in that same year. It is not disputed that the acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force is illegal, irrespective of whether the territory was acquired through a war of self-defence or of an act of aggression. The occupying Power cannot annex any part of the occupied territory and there is an obligation on States not to recognize such an illegal territorial acquisition. /n/nHowever, it is clear that Israel has turned the temporary nature of the occupation into a permanent situation, in violation of the Palestinian right to self-determination. It has done this through its illegal settlement enterprise, which now consists of an estimated 700,000 settlers  an increase of 235 per cent since the Oslo Peace Accords, and of 165 per cent since the Wall Opinion. /n/nIn that case, the Court found that Israel has taken measures that “severely impeded the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination”, in breach of that fundamental right. The very disruption of Palestinian territorial integrity resulting from those settlements as well as Israels formal and de facto annexation of parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, constitute further violations of that fundamental right. /n/nIn terms of international humanitarian law, the continuing construction and expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are in clear violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party and which the Court has found in the Wall case to be binding upon Israel. /n/nThe extent of human rights violations and discriminatory laws and practices by Israel with respect to the Palestinian population is well documented in various reports of the treaty-based and charter-based mechanisms of the United Nations and is recalled in resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. These policies and practices have reached the threshold of apartheid within the meaning ascribed to it in the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid."

First, because the opinion might prejudice a negotiation process aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which those States consider to be ongoing26. And second, because the questions posed concern a bilateral dispute between Israel and Palestine. Not only are those arguments misguided, but they have been repeatedly rejected by this esteemed Court under highly analogous circumstances, including in the Wall Advisory Opinion27. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the second argument raised by certain States is that the Court should refrain from rendering the requested opinion because it relates to a strictly bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine47. This argument has been rejected by the Court in several prior contexts, including in the Wall Advisory Opinion48, and should, we believe, be disposed of by the Court in the same manner in this case. /n/nNot only is the argument legally unfounded49, but the fact that the questions posed to the Court are of a multilateral nature is self-evident.

Israels actions in laying waste to the Gaza Strip, killing and maiming tens of thousands of innocent civilians, depriving them of food, water and the basic means of survival while displacing virtually the entire population of 2.3 million people are not justified under any circumstances. Israels actions have severely dehumanized the Palestinian population, treating them as dispensable objects rather than human beings. These disgraceful acts, which have brought about formal accusation before this esteemed Court that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian population, as well as an Order on provisional measures recognizing the plausibility of those accusations and ordering Israel to comply with its obligations under the Genocide Convention23, necessarily weigh heavily upon the consideration of the questions before the Court in this proceeding. For if nothing else, they demonstrate all too vividly how the illegality of the Israeli occupation over more than five decades can degenerate into the ugliest of consequences. /n/nThe only logical conclusion that can be drawn from all of this is that Israels policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are legally indefensible. /n/nIn the 2004 Wall proceedings, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia described Israels modus operandi in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 1967 as “deliberately enhance[ing] its position and chang[ing] the territorial status quo to its benefit”29.

The Court also warned “the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a ‘fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case . . . it would be tantamount to de facto annexation”31. This assessment was prescient, and tragically — but predictably — resulted in no change in Israels illegal conduct. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than in the number of illegal settlers residing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which has grown from roughly 424,000 in 200432 to some 700,000 settlers today33. /n/nSince 1967, far from engaging in negotiations, Israel has made it virtually impossible to establish a cohesive Palestinian State. It has done so by annexing more than 2 million dunams of land34, building more than 279 illegal settlements throughout the West Bank35, illegally annexing East Jerusalem and declaring Jerusalem as its undivided capital36, confiscating natural resources37, demolishing Palestinian homes38, and much more. Those actions are well documented in the many United Nations reports discussed in the Kingdoms Written Statement and I will not dwell on them further, except to make the self-evident point that Israels actions have clearly aimed at frustrating a negotiated settlement rather than opening the door to such a settlement39. /n/nWe submit that the catastrophic consequences of Israels policies and practices on the ground, as well as their sheer illegality, are undeniable. The international community has seen stark evidence of these consequences during the current war in Gaza. The ongoing situation is so appalling that last December the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza54, while the Court has recognized the plausibility that Israels conduct amounts to genocide and ordered it to comply with a series of provisional measures55. /n/nMoreover, Israel has continued implementing its infamous settlement practice in the Occupied Palestinian Territory despite the repeated condemnation of this practice by the Security Council and this Courts determination of their illegality in the Wall Advisory Opinion58. Yet Israel makes no secret of its intention to maintain and expand settlements, as well as its possession of all or part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by the use of force. /n/nIsraels 2018 Basic Law also shows Israels disdain for the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination by declaring the Holy City of Jerusalem “complete and united” as Israels capital. Stipulating that “[t]he exercise of the right to national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish People” is also incompatible with the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem59. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes to emphasize that international law obligations, particularly those embodied in the peremptory norms of general international law, are not abstract rules, and are not intended to be. Their violations entail particular legal consequences, but also have real and tangible consequences. The latter include most prominently the denial to human beings of their right to life and dignity, and more widely the creation of threats to peace and stability, with unpredictable consequences. The multiple and grave violations by Israel of its international obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is therefore of undeniable concern not only to those directly affected, but also to the international community as a whole61. /n/nTo be clear, Israels occupation was, from its commencement in June 1967, an illegal use of force, and it continues to be so. The Kingdom noted this in its submission in the Wall Advisory Opinion62. The illegal nature of the 56-year occupation has only been aggravated by Israels numerous other international law violations, including of jus cogens norms. Given the illegality surrounding every aspect of Israels occupation, that occupation is simply indefensible as a matter of international law."

And while the brutal and genocidal onslaught of Gaza by the Israeli military since October 2023 has led it to become, in the words of the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, a “place of death and despair”46, it should not be forgotten that Israels aggression has been accompanied by unyielding statements by its leaders that it will never agree to a sovereign Palestinian State or cede control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Such statements hardly reflect Israels intention to engage in genuine peace negotiations. /n/nHowever, as we speak, Israel continues to defy the international communitys call for a ceasefire and to wilfully ignore the provisional measures ordered by the Court. More generally, Israel has over the decades of its occupation persisted in its egregious violations of its most fundamental international law obligations. As explained in our Written Statement, Israel is in continuous breach of several jus cogens norms, notwithstanding multiple Security Council and General Assembly resolutions condemning its conduct and this Courts findings in the Wall Advisory Opinion56. /n/nThese violations include Israel taking continuous measures to prevent the Palestinian people from exercising their right of self-determination through various policies and practices, including, among others, the illegal settlement practice in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes and theft of Palestinian property, the denial of sovereignty over their natural resources, and the breach of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights57. /n/nBut Israels breaches of international law do not end there. There can be no serious debate that Israeli policies and practices also amount to racial discrimination and are tantamount to apartheid, in grave violation of the Palestinian peoples human rights. Israels seizure of land and resources for Israeli settlers and its discriminatory application of laws and regulations to the detriment of the Palestinian people are merely examples of this egregious conduct. Israel violates the human rights of the Palestinian people in multiple other ways and in breach of its conventional obligations, including the rights of women and children. /n/nI will now move on to the second question before the Court, regarding the manner in which Israels conduct affects the legal status of its occupation. The Kingdom respectfully submits that the only conclusion which may be reached from the multiple and grave breaches of international law emanating from its occupation is that Israels occupation itself is illegal and must be brought to an unconditional end. Any other conclusion would be anomalous and inconsistent with the clearly illegal origin and conduct of the occupation, including the violations of jus cogens norms, that Israel has and continues to engage in through its occupation."

      "texto": "As the Court knows quite well, the international system is based on certain fundamental principles of law, which include peremptory norms of international law, or jus cogens norms. Adherence to these norms is not subject to derogation and compliance with them is owed erga omnes — to the international community as a whole. Some of the recognized jus cogens norms include the prohibition of aggression, the prohibition of genocide, the prohibition of apartheid and the right to self-determination.\n\nIf a particular action of a State violates one or more jus cogens norms, that action is illegal under international law. Any State may invoke the responsibility of that State for such a violation and seek an immediate end to it.\n\nThis is, fundamentally, the situation regarding Israels occupation in the Palestinian territories. The international community, collectively over many years, has found Israels occupation of the Palestinian territories to be illegal, among other reasons, on account of its violation of multiple jus cogens norms. And collectively we have invoked Israels responsibility in that regard to end the occupation.\n\nMr President, at least one State in the course of these proceedings has suggested that an occupation under international law cannot be illegal under any circumstances. This argument posits that “an occupation exists, therefore it is legal”. The proposition is unfounded in international law and fails for several reasons.\n\nFirst, this argument confuses jus in bello, and completely ignores the jus ad bellum. As the Court is well aware, international humanitarian law, and the jus in bello, is the body of law that governs the ways in which warfare can be conducted. It includes within it the law of occupation, a body of rules regulating the conduct of an occupying Power. It is, indeed, true that the obligations under jus in bello as they relate to an occupation persist throughout the pendency of that occupation.\n\nBut separate from jus in bello is the jus ad bellum, or the conditions under which States may resort to armed force. It is the jus ad bellum that addresses the legality of a use of force, including an occupation, which is maintained by the ongoing use of force. Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter prohibits the threat or use of force in any “manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. The only exceptions to this prohibition are the very narrow circumstances of the force authorized by the United Nations Security Council or self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. Any use of force outside of these narrow exceptions — i.e. any annexation or occupation of territory arising from an act of aggression or otherwise unlawful use of force — is illegal. Any use of force that is unnecessary or disproportionate to the threat against which it is exercised is also illegal under jus ad bellum.\n\nSecond, the proposition that “an occupation exists, therefore it is legal” also ignores the existence and implications of jus cogens norms going beyond the jus ad bellum. If an occupation inherently violates one or more jus cogens norms, then it is illegal as a whole and the occupying Powers responsibility for that violation can be invoked in order to bring the violation to an end. The occupying Powers ongoing obligations under international humanitarian law do not, and cannot, preclude the wrongfulness of jus cogens violations inherent in the occupation itself.\n\nFor example, the argument that occupations are inherently legal, if adopted, would directly conflict with and undermine the prohibition on the annexation of territory. Any State that wanted to de facto annex a territory could do so by indefinitely occupying that territory but not formally incorporating it within its borders. It is the same with the jus cogens norms of the rights of self-determination. Simply put, flagrant violations of international law cannot be brushed aside by the fig leaf of occupation.\n\nFinally, the thesis that “an occupation exists, therefore it is legal” also ignores the fact that the Court has determined occupations to be unlawful in the past. As discussed in The Gambias Written Statement, this was the case regarding South Africas occupation of Namibia without title and regarding Ugandas occupation of the Congolese province of Ituri. The United Nations Security Council and the General Assembly have characterized occupations resulting from unlawful uses of force to be illegal as well.\n\nIn sum, a belligerent occupation can be illegal per se if it violates the jus ad bellum and other jus cogens norms."

      "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, The Gambia will highlight three reasons why Israels prolonged occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal. All three of these reasons — the right of self-determination, the prohibition on apartheid and the jus ad bellum — reflect obligations rooted in jus cogens norms. This conclusion of illegality is shared by a substantial majority of the Participants in these proceedings, many for the same reasons as The Gambia.\n\nThe right to self-determination\n\nFirst, Israels occupation violates the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and is therefore illegal. The erga omnes right of self-determination is “one of the essential principles of contemporary international law”, a jus cogens norm enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Court has before it extensive and uncontested fact-finding by multiple United Nations mandate holders, including the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the many reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. These reports have been produced by independent United Nations mandate holders who engaged in extensive fact-finding utilizing multiple sources of evidence. The Court should accept these reports as conclusive and convincing evidence of Israels long-standing, ongoing and indefinite infringement on the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people.\n\nIndeed, there is no end in sight to Israels occupation. Already extending over 56 years, Israels current leadership boasts with pride its long-standing efforts to prevent the creation of an independent Palestinian State. As reported by the United Nations Special Rapporteur, Israels “occupation violates Palestinians ability to organize themselves as a people, free from alien domination and control”.\n\nNo derogation is permitted from respecting the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. There is no escaping the conclusion that Israels occupation is illegal for violating the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and that it must expeditiously be brought to an end.\n\nThe prohibition on apartheid\n\nSecond, Israels ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories is also illegal because it amounts to a régime of apartheid, the prohibition of which is a peremptory norm of international law. This Court has described apartheid as a “flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter”.\n\nOnce again, the Court has before it extensive, credible and independent fact-finding demonstrating conclusively that Israel has imposed an apartheid reality in the Palestinian territories. This is clear in the reporting of the United Nations Special Rapporteur, who concluded that “Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world”. This is also reflected in the findings of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.\n\nSenior international leaders, like Ban Ki-moon, Desmond Tutu and former Israeli officials, including a former Attorney General, a former director of Israels Intelligence Service, Shin Bet, and a former Ambassador of Israel to South Africa, have also concluded that Israels occupation constitutes a régime of apartheid.\n\nThe most credible non-governmental human rights organizations that report on the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory have also concluded that the occupation is, in fact and in law, an apartheid régime.\n\nA sober review of the uncontroverted evidence convincingly shows that the occupation is a régime of apartheid. As such, Israels occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must urgently be brought to an end.\n\nThe jus ad bellum\n\nThird, Israels 56-year occupation of Palestinian territories violates the laws on the use of force — jus ad bellum — and is illegal for that reason as well.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the prohibition on the threat and use of force is a jus cogens norm. Even when resort to force is justified by self-defence in response to an armed attack, the particular force used may still be illegal if it is unnecessary or disproportionate to the threat against which it is exercised.\n\nIsrael launched the June 1967 war that led to its occupation of the Palestinian Territory. After its surprise attack initiating the war, Israel occupied all remaining Palestinian territory in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, as well as Syrias Golan Heights and Egypts Sinai Peninsula, “effectively tripling the size of territory under [its] control”. Since this use of force was not taken in response to an armed attack and was not necessary or proportionate even if it had been, the occupation was a flagrant violation of the laws of the use of force from the onset.\n\nFurthermore, even if the occupation of the Palestinian territories were lawful at one time, its continuation for more than five decades means that it could not possibly still be lawful today. First, the use of force in self-defence is only justified “within the strict confines” laid down in Article 51 of the Charter and “does not allow the use of force by a State to protect perceived security interests beyond [those] parameters”. As such, “essentially preventative” uses of force are beyond the scope of Article 51.\n\nSecond, as clarified in the Wall Advisory Opinion, Article 51 does not apply to situations involving conduct taken in response to purported threats emanating from within occupied territory. Israel therefore cannot justify its occupation as a response to illegal threats emanating from within the Occupied Palestinian Territory itself.\n\nIsraels ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories also violates the jus ad bellum because its maintenance is unnecessary and disproportionate. It is simply not possible that it has been necessary for Israel to maintain its occupation since 1967 — for over 56 years. Moreover, Israel also cannot possibly justify its settlements upon and annexation of occupied territory as a necessary response to any perceived threat — not to mention the myriad of rights violations that are intrinsic to the occupation. By settling and annexing occupied territory, Israel has acted unnecessarily in using force.\n\nIsraels prolonged occupation is also wholly disproportionate to any legitimate aim. Israels occupation of the entirety of the Palestinian territories “long after the period in which any presumed armed attack... could reasonably be contemplated” makes it even more disproportionate now. And the manner in which the occupation has been conducted — including the establishment of an apartheid régime — renders the occupation disproportionate as well. In sum, Israels decades-long occupation violates the jus ad bellum and is therefore illegal."

      "texto": "THE COURT SHOULD NOT BE DETERRED FROM PROVIDING AN ADVISORY OPINION WHICH ANSWERS IN FULL THE QUESTIONS POSED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nMr President, that belief is one that is shared by the overwhelming majority of States and international organizations which have chosen to participate in these advisory proceedings. However, a small number of States — just five in total — contend that the Court should decline to provide an advisory opinion because, they say, an opinion would prejudice negotiations between the State of Palestine and Israel. A further handful of States — which include the United States, from whom you heard earlier today — do not go quite so far, but they instead urge the Court to exercise caution to avoid undermining the existing negotiating 'framework'.\n\nBoth the advocates of abstention and the advocates of timidity are wrong. There are several reasons why the possible effect of an advisory opinion on negotiations between Israel and the State of Palestine does not constitute a good — still less a 'compelling' — basis for either declining to issue an opinion or for restricting its scope. I highlight two in particular.\n\nFirst, the arguments all rest on a fundamentally flawed factual premise. They assume the existence of ongoing negotiations between Israel and the State of Palestine which could be prejudiced by an advisory opinion. But such negotiations do not exist. There have been no negotiations between the two States for a decade. There are no live negotiations.\n\nAnd this is not a contentious proposition. Indeed, one of the most prominent and vocal advocates of judicial caution, the United States, expressly concedes in its Written Statement that negotiations between the two States 'are not currently occurring'. This is the unfortunate but very real actuality.\n\nNor, if the words of Israels leaders are anything to go by, is there any realistic prospect of Israels willing participation in such negotiations in the near future. Recent public statements by Israels Prime Minister make this abundantly clear. In November of last year, for example, Prime Minister Netanyahu proclaimed that Israel would prevent a Palestinian State in Gaza and the West Bank. That was a position he reiterated emphatically in January of this year.\n\nThe second — and more fundamental — reason why the Court should not be deterred from issuing an advisory opinion which answers in full the questions posed by the General Assembly, is that the General Assembly, the Security Council and this very Court have all made clear that the Israel-Palestine conflict must be — and can only be — resolved in accordance with international law.\n\nIn November 2022, for example, the General Assembly adopted resolution 77/25 which '[s]tress[ed] that compliance with and respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law... is a cornerstone of peace and security in the region'. The General Assembly called upon Israel 'to comply strictly with its obligations under international law and to cease all of its measures that are contrary to international law' including measures which seek to 'prejudg[e] the final outcome of peace negotiations'. The resolution went on to refer to 'the illegality of the annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory... which constitutes a breach of international law... and challenges the prospects for the achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace'.\n\nIn other words, a just, lasting and comprehensive peace necessarily requires compliance with international law.\n\nIn a similar vein, in February of last year, the President of the Security Council issued a statement which emphasized that '[t]he Security Council reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions. The Security Council strongly underscores the need for all parties to meet their international obligations'.\n\nIn the Wall Opinion, the Court likewise stressed the importance of 'achieving as soon as possible, on the basis of international law, a negotiated solution' in order to achieve 'peace and security for all in the region'. In his concurring opinion in that case, Judge Al-Khasawneh stressed that 'it is of the utmost importance if... negotiations are not to produce non-principled solutions, that they be grounded in law'.\n\nThe principal judicial organs of the United Nations have spoken emphatically and with one consistent voice. They could not be clearer that any negotiations between Israel and the State of Palestine must be grounded in international law and must be aimed at ensuring a resolution of the conflict which is in accordance with international law. It is obvious and it is self-evident that an advisory opinion containing the Courts answers to the questions of international law posed by the General Assembly will help, not hinder, the attainment of that end.\n\nIndeed, the very resolution which requested these advisory proceedings confirms that this is exactly what the General Assembly considers that an advisory opinion will help to achieve. Resolution 77/247 stressed the need to 'advanc[e] and accelerat[e] meaningful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a peace agreement that will bring a complete end to the Israeli occupation... and the resolution of all core final status issues... leading to a peaceful, just, lasting and comprehensive solution of the question of Palestine'.\n\nIn adopting this resolution, the General Assembly plainly considered that an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice would facilitate, rather than frustrate, 'negotiations' leading to 'a peaceful, just, lasting and comprehensive solution'.\n\nIt follows that the Court can and should answer the questions posed by the General Assembly confident in the knowledge that its answers will help to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict in accordance with international law."

      "texto": "Mr President, I turn now to an important issue of substance, namely whether as a matter of international law an occupation can be unlawful. The United States, as you heard earlier, contends that an occupation cannot be unlawful or lawful. It argues that occupation is governed exclusively by international humanitarian law, which is concerned only with the acts of the occupying Power and has nothing to say about the legality of the occupation itself. For the United States, when it comes to occupation international humanitarian law is both the start and the end; it is the only game in town.\n\nGuyana, like dozens of other States and international organizations, disagrees. Put simply, there is a distinction between the law of occupation, on the one hand, and the legality of an occupation, on the other. The conduct of an occupation is governed by international humanitarian law, while the legality of an occupation as a whole is determined by the United Nations Charter and general international law.\n\nThe argument advanced by the United States — that occupation is governed solely by international humanitarian law — leaves no room for the application of the Charter or general international law. In particular, it leaves no room for the principle enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the Charter that acquisition of territory by force is absolutely prohibited. An argument which leaves no room for the application of that fundamental principle of international law — a peremptory norm — is not a sound one.\n\nHow then does one determine whether Israels occupation of Palestinian territory is unlawful? The answer, Guyana submits, is straightforward. It is to be found in the principle that occupation is inherently and exclusively a temporary state of affairs, and in the jus cogens prohibition on acquisition of territory by force.\n\nThe inherently temporary character of occupation is reflected in the principle that an occupying Power does not acquire sovereignty — “not one atom”, as Oppenheim memorably put it — over the occupied territory. It is also reflected in the duty of the occupying Power to preserve the status quo ante and to refrain from making any permanent changes to the occupied territory. Temporariness, in short, is the very core and essence of occupation. It is notable that none of the 57 States and international organizations which filed written statements in these proceedings contend otherwise.\n\nIt follows that permanent “occupation” is not occupation at all; it is military conquest. It is annexation. And annexation is, of course, strictly forbidden under international law. It therefore necessarily follows that an “occupation” which is intended to be permanent is unlawful under international law."

This is a classic, quintessential example of de jure annexation — and it is irrefutable evidence that Israel intends its occupation to be permanent.\n\nOver many years Israels leaders have repeatedly proclaimed East Jerusalem to be an inseparable part of Israel.

These include the systematic implantation of more than 230,000 Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem — an exercise in deliberate demographic manipulation that has profoundly changed the composition, the character and the status of the Holy City.\n\nIn the rest of the West Bank, Israel has conducted a similar, decades-long process of implanting half a million Israeli settlers in more than 270 illegal settlements. Those settlements, and the network of settler-only roads and infrastructure which connect them, form a vast interconnected constellation of illegal colonies, to which Israel has extended the application of its domestic laws. The intent — and the effect — is to establish permanent Israeli dominion throughout the West Bank. Indeed, the highest officials in successive Israeli governments have openly and brazenly declared an intention to exercise sovereignty over the entire West Bank, which they have renamed Judea and Samaria, and which they define as an integral and inseparable part of the land of Israel.\n\nIsrael has created, expanded and entrenched its sprawling network of settlements in the face of repeated condemnation of the illegality of those actions by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Secretary-General, a plethora of United Nations committees and rapporteurs, as well as the international community and, of course, this very Court.\n\nIsraels annexation of the occupied territory and its intention for the occupation to be permanent has been widely recognized and condemned by the United Nations. I offer five examples, but I stress that these are merely illustrative, and they are very far from exhaustive.\n\nFirst, literally dozens of General Assembly resolutions from the early 1970s onwards have expressly referred to and condemned Israels “annexation” of the occupied territory. Examples of those resolutions, which span a period of more than half a century, are listed in Guyanas Written Statement. This vast corpus of resolutions demonstrates a clear, consistent and emphatic recognition by the General Assembly that Israel has unlawfully annexed much of the occupied territory with the intention of retaining it forever.\n\nSecond, multiple resolutions of the Security Council between 1968 and 2016 expressly recalled the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force and condemned Israels annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory on that basis. Examples of those resolutions are also listed in Guyanas Written Statement. Those resolutions represent a clear recognition by the Security Council that Israel has annexed most of the occupied territory in contravention of fundamental principles of international law, and that it intends to exert perpetual control over that territory.\n\nThird, successive Secretaries-General of the United Nations have also repeatedly described and condemned Israels “annexation” of Palestinian territory in official published reports. In 2010, for instance, the Secretary General referred to “Israels annexation of East Jerusalem” which is “a flagrant violation of international law”. In 2015, the Secretary-General reported to the General Assembly that: “In the West Bank... the establishment and maintenance of the settlements amount to a slow, but steady annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory.” Similar statements are once again cited in Guyanas Written Statement.\n\nFourth, the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry has also concluded that Israel has illegally annexed much of the West Bank and intends the occupation to be permanent. In its September 2022 report, the Independent Commission concluded that: “Israel treats the occupation as a permanent fixture and has — for all intents and purposes, annexed parts of the West Bank.” The report went on to describe Israels “settlement enterprise” as “the principal means” used by Israel “to create irreversible facts on the ground” to support “its permanent occupation”. The Commission added that “[s]tatements made by Israeli officials provide further evidence that Israel intends the occupation to be permanent”.\n\nFifth, successive United Nations Special Rapporteurs have similarly concluded that Israel has annexed the occupied territory. In 2021, for instance, the Special Rapporteur reported that Israels occupation “has become indistinguishable from annexation”. He highlighted “the de jure annexation plans made by Israel” and he cited the “plentiful... evidence” that “Israeli policies and practices” are designed to pursue “a strategy of de facto annexation and permanent control over the Palestinian territory”.\n\nIn a report published the following year, the Special Rapporteur observed that the implantation of hundreds of thousands of settlers in the occupied territory was intended to “demographically engineer an unlawful sovereignty claim through the annexation of the occupied territory”. He concluded that Israels occupation had “burst through the restraints of temporariness long ago” and that “Israel has progressively engaged in the de jure and de facto annexation of occupied territory”.\n\nMr President, Israels annexation of Palestinian territory, and its clear intention for the occupation to be permanent, render the occupation unlawful as a whole. This has already been recognized by the United Nations. In 2022, the Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that: “there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is now unlawful under international law owing to its permanence and to actions undertaken by Israel to annex parts of the land de facto and de jure”.\n\nIn January this year, the Secretary-General, citing international law and the resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly, concluded bluntly that: “Israels occupation must end.” When the United States read aloud from the Secretary-Generals statement earlier today, it regrettably excised these crucial words. However, the State of Palestine read them to you on Monday. As the State of Palestine pointed out, the Secretary-General stated one month ago that: “Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully independent, viable and sovereign State realized, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements. Israels occupation must end.”\n\nGuyana emphatically agrees, both with the Independent Commission of Inquiry and the Secretary-General. The occupation is unlawful. The occupation must therefore end — immediately, comprehensively, irreversibly."

      "pregunta": "Decides to comply with the request for an advisory opinion",
      "texto": "We put to the Court that there are compelling reasons to deny the request for an advisory opinion. All these reasons pertain to the issue of judicial propriety. The reasons include the specifics of the questions, the essentially bilateral nature of the dispute and the lack of consent of one of the parties, as well as the already existing legal framework for the resolution of pending issues and disputes between the parties.\n\nConsequently, the Hungarian Government is of the view that the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\nThere are three compelling reasons for the Court not to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\nMr President, we now turn to the second issue: the compelling reasons why the Court should reject to give an opinion on the request made by the General Assembly.\n\nWe recall the existing precedent for rejecting a request for an advisory opinion based on compelling reasons. The predecessor of the Court, the Permanent Court of International Justice, declined to issue an advisory opinion on the status of Eastern Carelia. This decision has never been overruled. We note that the Court, in its subsequent decisions, has always taken due care to demonstrate the factual differences from the Eastern Carelia case when considering the exercise of its jurisdiction. This must lead us to the conclusion that the legal criteria set out in that decision remain authoritative.\n\nAs to compelling reasons, we would like to bring the Courts kind attention to the following three considerations that individually, as well as cumulatively, may compel the Court to refrain from issuing an advisory opinion to the present questions.\n\nFirst, we express sincere doubt that the nature of the question would allow for an appropriate advisory opinion. While the title of the General Assembly resolution 77/247 speaks of “Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people”, the question posed in operative paragraph 18 of the resolution says: “legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination” and “related discriminatory legislation and measures”. The questions encompass a wide range of subject-matters, touching upon the legal status of the occupied Palestinian territories, the unspecified Israeli practices and the legal consequences of both the status of the occupied Palestinian territories as well as those practices. While the questions do not specify the actual practices and legislation, they already provide a distinct qualification stating their illegality and unlawful nature. Replying to these questions would inherently entail an affirmation of the statements incorporated in the question. Advisory proceedings were designed as an instrument to contribute to, and facilitate the work of, the requesting organs. These proceedings are not an appropriate forum for making the kinds of determinations that are implied in the question. As the Court put it in the Kosovo Advisory Opinion: Article 65 of the Statute of the Court has not created “a form of judicial recourse for States”. In our view, should the Court decide to reply to these questions in the form of an advisory opinion, that would be “tantamount to adjudication on the very subject-matter of the underlying concrete bilateral dispute that undoubtedly exists between Israel and Palestine”.\n\nThis leads us to our second consideration concerning the essentially bilateral nature of the dispute. At the outset, we duly take note of the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the conflict between Israeli and Palestinian parties is “located in a much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute”. However, it must be pointed out that this “broader frame of reference” has fundamentally changed due to the shifting political dynamics within the conflict. The Wall Advisory Opinion was issued during ongoing peace negotiations between the parties that, alas, have not yielded the desired outcome. Unfortunately, in recent years, despite repeated calls for relaunching good faith negotiations between the parties by the international community, including this very Court, the process has stalled. Deadlock continues to ensue and the conflict thus remains an acute bilateral dispute between the parties.\n\nOn this basis, we argue that providing an advisory opinion would inevitably raise the question of circumventing consent of Israel as a party to this bilateral dispute. We refer to the fact that Israel voted against resolution 77/247 in the General Assembly in 2022. Israels attitude in the previous decades has demonstrated its readiness to participate in different negotiations and peace processes. This is the very way the esteemed Court itself suggested solving this dispute.\n\nFor these reasons, we recall our request for the Court to exercise its right to decline rendering an advisory opinion.\n\nAvoiding unduly politicization and maintaining the existing negotiating frameworks are necessary to uphold the judicial character of the Court.\n\nAs for our third and final query, we refer to the already existing and accepted institutional architecture for maintaining international peace and security. In this institutional fabric, each actor has its own distinct role and responsibilities, as institutional guarantors of peace and security. Within this intricate system, it is the United Nations Security Council that has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security according to the United Nations Charter. Should the Court decide to render an advisory opinion on this matter, this would — in our opinion — inevitably result in the unduly politicization of the esteemed institution of an otherwise strictly judicial character. This could threaten to undermine its ability to contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. Additionally, such an opinion, irrespective of its content, would inevitably become part of an already heated political debate, particularly in the aftermath of the barbaric Hamas terrorist attacks conducted on 7 October 2023.\n\nFurthermore, when discussing the institutional backdrop to this conflict, it must be pointed out, that there is, in fact, an established framework for negotiations aimed at the political settlement of the conflict, emanating from the various United Nations Security Council resolutions, such as resolutions 242 and 338. Moreover, to this day, this established negotiation framework, built around the Oslo Accords, remains the recognized framework by both parties to the conflict.\n\nIt is crucial to also mention the involvement of other international mechanisms and actors in the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO). The role of the Special Coordinator is important in facilitating dialogue and negotiations, promoting peace and coordinating international efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive resolution.\n\nTherefore, one must come to the conclusion that if we are to stay true to this very Courts ruling issued in the Wall Advisory Opinion, what is needed today is not a new legal interpretation, but a renewed effort to restart peace negotiations, implementing in good faith all relevant existing United Nations Security Council resolutions."

      "texto": "In discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one must reflect on the broader political context.\n\nHungary recalls that in 2004 this esteemed Court clearly stated in its Advisory Opinion concerning the Construction of a Wall case that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties, on the basis of international law and through the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Since 2004, this fundamental approach has not changed, although numerous aspects of the political context have shifted. As Hamas came to power in 2007, it rejected fundamental pillars of the existing political framework, in particular the Quartet principles, including Israels right to exist, as well as renouncing violence as a means of achieving goals, and adherence to previous agreements between the parties. This has significantly affected the existing peace initiatives and has induced intra-Palestinian divisions that have proven difficult to resolve over the years.\n\nWe must also note more recent developments that have yielded significant change in the broader political dynamics of the conflict. The Abraham Accords established in 2020 provided a novel approach that has allowed for the normalization of relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries. We believe that in a political sense the Abraham Accords represented an effort to create a more conducive environment for the negotiated settlement of the conflict. Moreover, it aimed to provide a solid foundation for enhancing regional peace, prosperity and stability.\n\nUnfortunately, the progress of these promising developments were imperilled by the horrendous terrorist attacks conducted against Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023. What happened on 7 October was one of the worst terrorist attacks and sexual barbarism the world has seen in a hundred years. On that Saturday morning, innocent Israeli civilians were awakened by an unprecedented brutal terrorist attack, the launching of thousands of rockets, the torturing and killing of hundreds, among them babies, and Hamas taking more than 200 hostages. Hungary strongly condemns these horrific terrorist attacks and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. These actions are not just an attack on a democratic country—they represent an assault on all democracies around the world. These actions are not just a clear violation of international law, they are also crimes against humanity. Israel has since been fighting the terrorist organization Hamas, with the aim to eradicate terrorists and to prevent such horrific terrorist attacks ever happening again. The evil of terrorists is well shown by the fact that they use innocent civilians, education and healthcare facilities as shields. Sparing the lives of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians is of the utmost importance—now, as well as in the future, in the interest of a sustainable peace, free of terror.\n\nWe welcome that the esteemed Court has recently called for immediate and unconditional release of the hostages held by Hamas and underlined that all parties to the conflict must abide by international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Upholding the rules is non-negotiable. Nonetheless, we must also note that the proceedings brought before this esteemed Court may directly contribute to the escalation of the conflict. We are of the view that both the present proceedings, as well as the proceedings against the State of Israel in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip, may be considered as provocations in the ongoing conflict, not contributing to the de-escalation and an eventual settlement of the conflict. A potential utilization of the Court in the communication war could create newer dividing lines and could continue to fuel tensions in one of the most severe conflicts of recent history.\n\nBearing in mind this aforementioned broader context, let me now turn to addressing three main issues that Hungary considers important to highlight."

      "texto": "The other key problem that leads to continuous violations of human rights of Palestinians are the Israeli settlement activities. This policy, sometimes referred to as creation of “facts on the ground”, was launched back in 1967 and has led to progressive shrinking of Palestinian lands. This has effectively undermined prospects of a negotiated solution of the one element of the final status, namely the issues of territory and borders. The overall number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is over 700,000. The situation is exacerbated by other arbitrary moves by the Israeli authorities, such as confiscation of lands, demolition of homes and prohibition of new construction. Most recently, this has been accompanied by violence emanating from Israeli settlers.\n\nIn 2023, that is, after the present request for an advisory opinion was made, the settlement activities of Israel have gained a record-breaking speed. Thus, according to the latest report of the United Nations Secretary-General, in 2023, plans for more than 24,700 housing units were advanced, approved or tendered. This is more than double the 11,700 units in 2022, which in itself was a remarkable figure.\n\nDuring the current wave of violence, we have witnessed public statements by Israeli cabinet members announcing plans to resume settlement activities in the Gaza Strip. Thus, on 28 January 2024, at a conference in West Jerusalem, cabinet ministers openly called for deportation of Palestinians from Gaza and presented a map with 21 settlement blocs. One cannot help noting that the event was held two days after this Court indicated provisional measures in the South Africa v. Israel case. The Court agreed that the situation in Gaza poses risks of irreparable harm to the rights of Palestinians guaranteed by the Genocide Convention. This fact alone underscores the gravity of the situation.\n\nIn this connection, it is worth recalling that this Court, in its Advisory Opinion on the Wall, recognized that “the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) ha[d] been established in breach of international law”. As explained in that Advisory Opinion, the settlements are contrary to the principle of inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force. They also contradict the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibiting transfers of population and deportations from an occupied territory. Resolutions of the Security Council have characterized that policy as changing the legal status and geographical nature of the occupied territories, and materially affecting their demographic composition.\n\nIn its resolution 2334, the Security Council reaffirmed that the settlements “have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace”.\n\nThis policy is aggravated by numerous violations of other rules of international humanitarian law and human rights law. These include the right to life, to respect for private and family life, to property, to freedom of movement, to freedom of religion, to work, to health, to education, and to an adequate standard of living.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this policy continues unabated, in defiance of Security Council resolutions and the Quartet Roadmap12. Importantly, as stressed in resolution 2334, the settlements are “dangerously imperilling the viability of the two-State solution based on the 1967 lines”. They are thus also violating the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n\nIsraeli policies in Palestine, to Russias deep regret, include other international law violations. Many examples have been provided by other delegations here. The Russian Federation expects the Court to give them due consideration.\n\nThe continued Israeli occupation of Palestine impedes the realization of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination. Israeli settlements are contrary to the principle of inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force. They also run counter to the prohibition of transfer and deportation of population of an occupied territory. The settlement activities are aggravated by numerous other violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. All States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from Israels violations."

Full respect for the principle of consent is a crucial importance for the integrity of international judicial procedures.\n\nSecondly, the international community has established a solid legal framework for the Middle East peace process. This legal framework is a universally recognized and a legally binding one. It contains crucial elements that effectively coincide with the aims of international responsibility.

For these reasons, we respectfully submit that the Court, when giving an advisory opinion in this case, should be guided by the principles of the peace process and should actively seek to give an opinion that would contribute to their implementation.\n\nIsrael shall terminate its breaches of international law. It must in particular cease all settlement activities and all other activities that impede reaching a final status agreement. At the same time, discussion on Israels responsibility must remain within the limits imposed by the advisory nature of these proceedings and to the need to create conditions for successful final status negotiations."

We also support relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council based on the reports of its Special Rapporteurs. In todays statement, let me focus on two of the most important aspects.\n\nThe first one is the persistent denial by Israel of the right of Palestinians to self-determination. The right to self-determination through the establishment of an independent Palestinian State has been at the heart of efforts of the international community. This right has been recognized by the General Assembly, the Security Council and by this Court.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the principle of self-determination of peoples is one of the foundations of the United Nations, mentioned in the very first Article of its Charter. Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples of their right to self-determination. Meanwhile, as recognized by the General Assembly, the protracted Israeli occupation prevents the Palestinians from implementing that right.\n\n“An end to the Israeli occupation” has been identified as a goal for the international community by legally binding resolutions of the Security Council, including resolution 2334. Israel is accordingly under an obligation to cease its violations of international law and to allow the Palestinian people to establish an independent State. This necessarily means that the occupation must come to an end.\n\nIsrael and Palestine are under an obligation to conduct, in good faith and without delay, negotiations aimed at reaching a final status agreement. All States and international organizations are under an obligation to contribute to creating conditions for such negotiations. The agreement thus reached shall result in the implementation by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination and emergence of an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.

      "texto": "President, Members of the Court, the Palestinian people have an inalienable right to self-determination and complete independence, which has always been systematically denied to them.\n\nThe League of Nations Mandate territories had a right to independence which was realized for all of them — except for Palestine.\n\nThe United Nations Charter enshrined the right to self-determination for the protection of all peoples except, in practice, for the Palestinians, more than half of whom were massacred or driven off their land in the 1948 Nakba. Their land was partitioned and half of it allocated to a new State that promptly extended it to 78 per cent by brute force.\n\nIn 1967, just seven years after resolution 1514, Israel commenced its still-continuing occupation of the entirety of the remaining Palestinian territory.\n\nSince then, Israel has, through its systematic manipulation of negotiations to undermine the presumed objectives, ensured that the Palestinian people are prevented from ever exercising that right.\n\nIsrael cannot be permitted to continue flouting one of the most fundamental principles of international law with impunity. Impunity breeds inhumanity.\n\nThe right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is violated in many ways. I will focus on three.\n\nFirst, the exclusion of Palestinians from any part of the Palestinian territory denies their right to territorial integrity, which is an essential part of the right to self-determination. The Palestinian people have a right to self-determination within the entirety of their territory.\n\nYet Israel has systematically removed and excluded Palestinians from parts of their territory. It has separated Gaza from the West Bank and prevented the free movement of Palestinians within the Palestinian territory. It has prohibited the return of Palestinians to their homes and property and established exclusionary illegal settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\n\nThis is especially egregious because many of these almost 700,000 State-supported settlers are continuously terrorizing and forcibly displacing Palestinians from even more of their territory and engaging in pogroms against them.\n\nSecond, Israel denies the existence of Palestinians as a people. The Israeli Minister of Finance, himself an illegal settler, has stated that “theres no such thing as a Palestinian people”. Senior Israeli leaders routinely deny that the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination. Moreover, the case brought by South Africa which Belize fully supports lays bare the fact that Israels genocidal campaign in Gaza also denies the right of Palestinians to exist at all.\n\nOne key tactic in this regard is Israels deliberate use of starvation to destroy the civilian population of Gaza. Gazas entire population of more than two million people is in crisis, facing the “worst levels of acute food insecurity”. By December 2023, the famine threshold had already been exceeded and the situation was deteriorating rapidly. This famine is not an accident. Indeed, senior Israeli officials have already clearly stated their intent to deprive civilians in Gaza of food and water.\n\nIn its planned erasure of the Palestinian people, Israel is also destroying Palestinian cultural, educational and historical institutions in Gaza. Almost 400 schools and every single university have been partially or fully destroyed, including one which was used as a base and interrogation centre by Israeli forces for months before they pillaged it and then detonated it. The intention is to erase all traces of Palestinian life and culture, to destroy the very essence of what makes the Palestinians a “people”. The message is clear: the total culture of Palestine must be destroyed and they must have no future in Gaza.\n\nThird, Israel is using forcible action to deprive the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination, freedom and complete independence. This includes the right of the Palestinian people “freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development”. Israels forcible action that denies the right to self-determination consists of institutional, coercive policies and practices that exert authority over and oppress the Palestinian people. These include: the complete control exercised over Palestinian natural and economic resources; the institutionalized and racist apartheid and the systematic and excessive use of force, arbitrary killing and mass incarceration of Palestinians, including children.\n\nIt also includes action taken by Israel to deny Palestinian political participation by criminalizing political speech and membership of, or connection with, Palestinian political parties.\n\nAs the United Nations rightly says, by depriving Palestinians of their fundamental rights, Israel has taken away their “agency and ability to unite, self-govern and develop as a polity”.\n\nThe consequence of this breach is that Israel must immediately, unconditionally and totally withdraw from all of the Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael is determined to ensure that the Palestinian people do not now and do not ever exercise their right to self-determination. Israel considers itself an exception. No State reserves to itself the right to systematically violate the right of a people to self-determination  except Israel. No State seeks to justify the indefinite occupation of anothers territory except Israel. No State commits annexation and apartheid with impunity except, it seems, Israel.\n\nBut Israel must not be allowed such blatant impunity. It must not be allowed to continue to inflict scars for generations to come on those that survive this holocaust. Israel must be made to behave like all civilized nations, stop violating international law and United Nations resolutions, and respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n\nPalestine must be free."

      "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, apartheid is “the strongest concentration of racist concepts put into action”. It goes hand-in-hand with Israels violation of the right to self-determination. It is impossible to realize a peoples right to self-determination within an “institutionalised regime of systematic racial oppression and discrimination”. The dehumanizing nature of apartheid suppresses the equality, identity and dignity at the heart of self-determination.\n\nThe existence of apartheid is relevant to the first question before the Court, which asks about the “legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination... and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures”. Although the Court can opine on discrimination falling short of apartheid, there are significant and different legal consequences resulting from the breach of the prohibition of apartheid that arises on the facts before the Court.\n\nI will address the definition and scope of apartheid; apply the definitional elements to the facts; and set out the legal consequences.\n\nThe Apartheid Conventions definition reflects custom and has the same content as the term “apartheid” in Article 3 of CERD. The prohibition of apartheid is not limited to southern Africa or commission by a particular State.\n\nThe prohibition also applies beyond a States territory. Article 3 of CERD refers to “territories under [a States] jurisdiction”, which includes situations of occupation. The CERD Committee has determined that Article 3 applies to the “Palestinian population in Israel... and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.\n\nFirst, it is indisputable that the Palestinians are a “racial group” for the purposes of CERD and custom. Under Israeli law, the separate identity of the Jewish race is afforded a privileged status and the right to exercise self-determination in the State of Israel is “exclusive to the Jewish people”. Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are perceived by themselves and by external actors as different racial groups.\n\nSecond, Israels deployment of a combination of measures across the Palestinian territory, and against the Palestinian people, falls within Article II of the Apartheid Convention. Israel has long-standing discriminatory laws, policies and practices that affect only Palestinians and are designed to benefit exclusively, and maintain the dominance of, Israeli Jews, on both sides of the Green Line. Moreover, many measures are designed to fragment the Palestinian people as a group, and to separate Palestinians from Israeli Jews. This is what Namibia rightly calls “strategic fragmentation.\n\nSuch measures have been set out in Belizes Written Statement. Here, I emphasize two points. First, in the West Bank, there is the separation wall, restrictive permit requirements, checkpoints and segregated roads. This creates what the Israeli army officially calls “sterilization” areas and roads closed to Palestinians. “Hebronization” meaning the strategies of repression and segregation is spreading.\n\nSecond, Gaza is under siege and blockade. Millions of Palestinians are confined to ever-smaller strips of land the longest and most complete siege of the greatest number in modern history. The whole of Gaza has become an impoverished, desperate ghetto.\n\nSince 1967, Israel has detained one million Palestinians, including tens of thousands of children.\n\nIsraels conduct against the Palestinian people has been characterized as apartheid by United Nations Special Procedures since 2007, including a joint statement of 47 mandate holders in 2020.\n\nTurning to the third element of apartheid: intent. Israels measures are imposed “for the purpose” of establishing and maintaining dominance and systematic oppression. This can be inferred from their scale and institutionalized nature, and from the differing effects they have on the Palestinian and Israeli peoples as regards access to basic services and rights protection. It is also directly evidenced by Israeli laws that affirm Jewish supremacy as a “national value”. Intent is heard in the hate speech of Israeli public officials, and political and religious leaders. The Court has ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to members of the Palestinian group in... Gaza”. Intent is also evidenced by Israels suppression of dissent against the system of apartheid.\n\nIndoctrination starts in the classroom. The CERD Committee has expressed concern at the “tide of racist hate speech... in school curricula and textbooks”. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has pointed to “the extensive militarization of the educational system”, which is entrenched during compulsory military service. Israels State Comptroller has criticized the Government for “doing very little to purge the severe phenomena of racism and hatred among youth and to promote a shared society”.\n\nIf the requisite intent is established, any claimed security rationale cannot displace the conclusion that Israels conduct falls within Article II.\n\nIn the light of these violations of self-determination and the prohibition of apartheid, Belize requests the Court to formulate precisely what Israel and third States must do. Specific consequences facilitate accountability.\n\nBelize refers to the written pleadings that detail such consequences. The core consequence of the violation of the jus cogens right to self-determination and the prohibition of apartheid is immediate cessation; Israel must dismantle the physical, legal and policy régime of discrimination and oppression, including freeing political prisoners; evacuate Israeli settlers from Palestinian territories; permit Palestinians to return to their country and property; and lift the siege and blockade of Gaza. These consequences, taken collectively, mean that Israel must immediately, unconditionally and totally withdraw from the entire Palestinian territory. This legal consequence applies irrespective of the outcome of the Courts consideration of occupation and annexation. Israel must also make full reparation for the damage suffered as a result of its violations.\n\nUnlawful occupation. On occupation, Belize makes three points. The first is that Israel is currently occupying all of the Palestinian territory. Secondly, the rules of international law applicable to determine whether the existence of that occupation is lawful are the rules on the use of force, the jus ad bellum. Thirdly, when those rules are applied to this occupation, it is evident that the occupation is neither necessary nor proportionate and is thus unlawful.\n\nIsrael is currently occupying all of the Palestinian territory.\n\nOn the first, Belize will concentrate today on Israel being in occupation of Gaza. That was the case before October last year and remains the case.\n\nIn July last year, Belize submitted that a State could be in occupation of territory even if it no longer has soldiers in it, if that State could “at any time they desired assume physical control of” the territory and had “the capacity to send troops within a reasonable time to make the authority of the occupying power felt”. That was a tragically prescient submission. Israel has since 7 October certainly made its power felt, and not just in the form of responding to the attack on it. Its recent conduct is a continuation and intensification of its long-term control over, violence against and incursions into Gaza. Israel controls who and what enters and leaves Gaza, including by air and sea, as well as the supply of water and energy. Gaza is under Israeli occupation and has been since 1967.\n\nJus ad bellum as the applicable law.\n\nI turn then to the rules applicable to determining whether Israels ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territory as a whole is lawful.\n\nThe position of the United States is that the jus ad bellum determines the lawfulness of territory becoming occupied, but not of its remaining occupied. On that approach, an occupying Power that has lawfully established an occupation would be unrestrained by law as to how long that occupation lasts. It would be restrained by the jus in bello as to how it conducts the occupation, but it would be under no legal restraint concerning the duration of the occupation. That would of course mean that an occupation could lawfully become indefinite, and that must be incorrect.\n\nThe correct position is that whether the existence of an occupation is lawful, either at the time of its commencement or as it continues, is determined by the jus ad bellum. That follows from the fact that an occupation is a use of force. Even if a use of force is initially necessary and proportionate, once either of those two conditions ceases to be met, the continuing use of force will become unlawful. That applies as much to occupations as it does to any other use of force.\n\nIsraels occupation of Palestinian territory is unlawful.\n\nApplying the rules on the use of force to this case, Israels occupation of Palestinian territory in June 1967 has been unlawful from its inception.\n\nIn any event, Israels occupation is certainly not now necessary or proportionate. If the occupation was ever lawful, it was part of Israels use of force against Egypt and Jordan in 1967. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and so its occupation of Gaza has been unlawful since at least that time. Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994 and so its occupation of the West Bank has been unlawful at least since then.\n\nGuatemala has nonetheless argued in these proceedings that, in light of the events of 7 October, Israel should not be required to cease its presence in Gaza or the West Bank.\n\nConcerning the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on no conceivable basis could it credibly be said that Israels continuing occupation of the West Bank is a necessary or proportionate response to the recent attack by Hamas from Gaza.\n\nConcerning Gaza, Israels use of overwhelming force including its ongoing occupation of Gaza is plainly not a necessary or proportionate response to the October attack.\n\nIn enforcing its occupation, Israel is committing breaches of international humanitarian law, in both Gaza and the West Bank. They are not, however, the breaches that lead to the most important consequences in this case. The fundamental issue, from which the most important consequences follow, is that it is unlawful for Israel to be exercising any control at all in respect of Palestinian territory.\n\nThat brings us to annexation.\n\nWhether a State has unlawfully annexed territory depends on two things: first, whether the State has physically seized the territory, and second, whether it has an intention to make the territory its own.\n\nThe requisite intention can be evidenced by a formal declaration of annexation, but it can also exist implicitly if the State has “clearly manifested its intention to hold the... territory permanently under its dominion”. That is what the Court has described as “de facto annexation”.\n\nIn one form or another, Israel has annexed all of the Palestinian territory. This is clear from the map you have seen used by the Prime Minister of Israel before the General Assembly last September that showed the West Bank and Gaza as part of Israel.\n\nFor East Jerusalem, the position is the most straightforward, since Israel has formally annexed it under Israeli law.\n\nFor the remainder of the West Bank, it is hardly less obvious.\n\nIsrael has occupied the entirety of the West Bank for 57 years with no plan for withdrawal or acknowledgement of any need or intention to ever withdraw.\n\nOn the contrary, it has an increasingly active programme of settling hundreds of thousands of Israelis in hundreds of settlements in the West Bank. These are permanent settlements on land that Israel is treating as its own.\n\nIsraeli officials thus speak of all of the West Bank as land over which Israel is sovereign.\n\nThese statements are matched by Israels transfer of administrative powers relating to the entirety of the West Bank from its military to its civilian authorities. That is a clear manifestation of the progression from occupation to annexation.\n\nAll of this is in the context of Israel refusing to recognize the existence of the Palestinian people as a people, or their right to self-determination and Statehood.\n\nThese circumstances have led United Nations bodies and special procedures correctly to conclude that Israel is responsible for de facto annexation of the entire West Bank, and not only of the part of it that the Oslo Accords label Area C. Area C constitutes more than 60 per cent of the West Bank and as the Court has seen from the fourth map that Palestines Foreign Minister displayed, it is clear that Areas A and B comprise a collection of isolated enclaves that are not viable without Area C.\n\nConsequences for Israel\n\nTurning to the heart of the questions posed to the Court, which is legal consequences, Israels occupation and annexation of Palestinian territory are continuing wrongful acts. Israel is thus under an obligation to cease those acts.\n\nWhether in respect of occupation or annexation, the conduct that constitutes a breach of the prohibition of the use of force is Israels presence in or exercise of effective control over Palestinian territory.\n\nTo cease that wrongful conduct, Israel must entirely withdraw from Palestinian territory. That includes withdrawing its civilian population from the West Bank, ceasing the construction and expansion of settlements there, and dismantling existing settlements.\n\nIt must also repeal or render ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts, policies and practices that contribute to its exercise of effective control over Palestinian territory.\n\nThe Court could also usefully indicate that the establishment of settlements has had no legal effect and does not give Israel any rights in respect of the land on which they are located.\n\nAs to the important question of timing, the Court has previously recognized that the obligation of cessation requires immediate action.\n\nIn the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court drew attention to the need for efforts to initiate negotiations. Israel interprets this to mean that it can remain in Palestinian territory until a negotiated solution to the entire conflict is reached. Belizes Written Comments are devoted to explaining why that is incorrect. The core difficulty is that Israel is not entitled to remain in breach of peremptory norms pending a negotiated solution. It is therefore crucial that the Court specify that Israel is required to withdraw from the Palestinian territory immediately, unconditionally and totally."

      "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, it is an honour to appear before you on behalf of the Plurinational State of Bolivia to address an issue of vital importance for the international community. Today, the world looks to this Court, the principal judicial body of the United Nations, which is empowered to determine the legal consequences arising from Israels continued violations of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination; from its prolonged acts of occupation; from its continued settlements and annexation of Palestinian territory, including measures which alter the demographic composition, character and status of the holy city of Jerusalem; and the adoption by Israel of related discriminatory legislation and measures, as requested by the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\nThe right to self-determination is enshrined in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter. In 1970, General Assembly resolution 2625, confirmed, as put by this Court in 2019, the normative character of its right under customary international law. Resolution 2625, the Friendly Relations declaration, confirmed that the duty of each State is “to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples of their right to self-determination and freedom and independence” and to “promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples”.\n\nThe continued siege of Palestinian people through Israels illegal occupation, annexation and colonization since 1948 has systematically and forcibly discriminated, displaced and fragmented the Palestinian people by deliberately denying them their recognized inalienable right to self-determination and their right to return to their homeland, where the State of Israel is now illegally established. The illegal Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories constitutes a denial of this right and, in this sense, Israel violates the right enshrined under international law.\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, this Court reminded Israel of its obligations under international law, reaffirming that it was “bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law”.\n\nBolivia considers that the General Assembly resolution 15 of August 2004 expands on fundamental aspects of this Courts Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including as regards East Jerusalem and its surroundings. Accordingly, they form part of the context to be considered in relation to the legal consequences of Israels policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory which we are analysing during this period at the Court.\n\nThus, Mr President, Members of the Court, Bolivia contends that by continuously depriving and denying the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination for 75 years, Israel is in clear breach of its international obligations.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, Article 2 of the United Nations Charter contains a general rule against the unlawful use of force and states that “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. The prohibition of aggression is binding on all States, and it constitutes a peremptory norm of international law.\n\nOn 22 November 1967, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967), in which it insisted on the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and called for the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces.\n\nBy the same token, through resolution 252 of 21 May 1968, the Security Council reaffirmed the point, considering that “all legislative and administrative measures and actions adopted by Israel, including the expropriation of land and property therein, that tend to change the legal status of Jerusalem are invalid and cannot change that status”.\n\nIt is imperative to recall that the Security Council urged Israel to scrupulously observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law on military occupation, further reiterating that the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilians in Time of War applied to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem.\n\nIn particular, Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention protects against colonization of occupied territory by providing that “[t]he occupying Power may not carry out the evacuation or transfer of any part of its own civilian population to the territory occupied by it”.\n\nYet, the transfer of 750,000 Israeli settlers and the building of settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank have been deliberately carried out with the intention of acquiring the territory through de facto and de jure annexation, including through colonization, confinement and fragmentation of the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nNot only the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, but also the General Assembly, reaffirmed the principle of inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, condemned and rejected Israeli measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, the character and status of Jerusalem and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. States in their international relations must refrain from resorting to the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or coerce another State to subordinate it in the exercise of its sovereign rights and obtain advantages of any type.\n\nBolivia considers that Israeli colonial settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Syrian Golan, have been built by force, through the imposition of institutionalized, racially discriminatory régimes (including apartheid) and through the denial of the exercise of the right to self-determination in contravention of international law. As a result, they must be considered illegal. Similarly, Israels occupation results from an act of aggression and, as such, it must be considered illegal under both jus in bello and jus ad bellum.\n\nThe Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, in its 2023 study of the legality of the Israeli occupation, endorsed the growing body of evidence that Israels belligerent occupation of the Palestinian territory is illegal in so far as it denies the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right to an independent State of Palestine.\n\nThe occupying Power lacks the right of sovereignty over the occupied territory, as confirmed by the principle of permanent inviolability of the rights of the protected population in the event of annexation, which is enshrined in Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. The occupying Power cannot alienate the land or the properties of the occupied State.\n\nThus, Bolivia considers that the Israeli colonialist occupations are clearly illegal according to jus in bello, and are illegal occupations because there is a violation of the normative order and the legal régime of the occupation such as the principles of temporality, the prohibition of annexation by force, serious violations of human rights and the right to self-determination, inalienability of sovereignty and the prohibition of racial discrimination, apartheid and, more recently, genocide.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, Bolivia observes with concern that Israels actions of persecution, oppression and domination of the Palestinian people have been accompanied by systematic violations of fundamental human rights that have been observed by both the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. This includes a system of racial discrimination and a system of apartheid that has not abated despite repeated condemnations from the international community.\n\nThe Human Rights Council has repeatedly called for the immediate protection of Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in accordance with human rights standards and international humanitarian law. It has further stressed all policies and measures adopted by Israel to limit access of Palestinians to their holy sites, in particular in occupied East Jerusalem, on the basis of their national origin, religion, birth, sex or any other status, violate the relevant provisions set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil Rights and Political Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Times of War; these measures must cease. “Israel is under an obligation to cease its wrongful conduct”.\n\nThe international community has repeatedly condemned Israels actions, including through the United Nations, in so far as they hinder the exercise of the Palestinian right to self-determination. These have included the construction of illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, the construction of the separation wall in the West Bank, and other measures that affect the daily lives of Palestinians. Bolivia has consistently joined these condemnations.\n\nIsraels occupation, both in its means and its purpose, does not fall within the framework of legality established in international law. The de facto annexation of territory imposes restrictions on where Palestinians can live and travel, as well as a racially discriminatory legal and administrative régime that favours Israeli settlers and deprives Palestinians of their most basic rights.\n\nThe conclusion is unavoidable that Israel has used its prolonged occupation as a pretext to pursue its illegal objective of annexing the occupied Palestinian territories, in violation of the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, the Israeli occupation must be considered illegal in its entirety.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, the policies and practices of Israeli occupation in Palestinian territory are illegal and have legal consequences with obligations for Israel and for other States and the United Nations, since they violate the rights of the Palestinians as a people and of Palestine as a State and therefore they both demand the complete and immediate cessation of these illicit international acts."

These measures may include diplomatic actions, economic sanctions, political pressure and legal measures.\n\nStates have the obligation to contribute with separate or joint actions to the State of Palestines exercise of its right to self-determination. States parties to the Genocide Convention also have clear obligations to act to prevent, suppress and punish genocide, employing “all means reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible within the limits permitted by international law”, also clarified in the 2024 Ukraine v. Russia case.\n\nThe Plurinational State of Bolivia considers that the Presidential Declaration of the Security Council of 20 February 2023 firmly underlines the need for all parties to comply with their international obligations and commitments. In this sense, States have the obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the acts of occupation of the territories of Palestine by Israel, the impediment to the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, the prevention of discrimination, apartheid and genocide and avoid any act of complicity and action that contributes to the maintenance of these illegal situations.\n\nBolivia believes that all States must firmly oppose all unilateral measures that impede peace, including, among others, to refrain the arms trade, the construction and expansion of Israeli settlements, the confiscation of Palestinian lands and the “legalization” of settlements, the demolition of Palestinian homes and the displacement of Palestinian civilians. States have to reject the expansionist and colonialist policies that Israel has been developing for half a century, promoting a system of apartheid and constant suffocation and genocide against the Palestinian people, in violation of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the respective resolutions approved by the Security Council, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.\n\nAs a pacifist country, the Plurinational State considers that the only alternative to guarantee a just and lasting peace in the conflict between Israel and Palestine must be the obligation for all States to contribute to dialogue and negotiation, with clear expressions of political will from both parties, to achieve a two-State solution, consolidating a free, sovereign and independent Palestinian\n\nState as it is established with the pre-1967 international borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the relevant Security Council and the General Assembly resolutions. Following the principles of international law and peace, Bolivia recognized Palestine as an independent and sovereign State on 17 December 2010 along the 1967 border because it meets all the traditional criteria for statehood.\n\nAll States have common but differentiated responsibilities and the obligations to provide solidarity and assistance to the Palestinian people. Accordingly, and despite its economic limitations, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is making an important effort by sending a contingent of humanitarian aid, which we hope can reach its destination without objection from the occupying\n\nPower.\n\nBolivia further considers that the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice, as well as the relevant treaty bodies, must continue to call on Israel to comply with its obligations under international law, to cease the expansion of illegal settlements, and guarantee the full exercise, enjoyment and respect of the human rights of the Palestinian population.\n\nSimilarly, the United Nations has the obligation to implement all relevant resolutions and other necessary measures and additional resolutions to bring to an end to Israels illegal occupation and the present system of racial discrimination and apartheid.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, every day we witness atrocities and an increasing irreparable loss of lives of the Palestinian people; the news documents daily the suffering, we know not what legal consequences these international crimes may yield, as they continue notwithstanding the Order on provisional measures of 26 January 2024.\n\nWith its advisory opinion, the Court has the power to establish what these consequences are."

Brazil believes that the Courts pronouncement is necessary so that not only Israel, as the occupying Power, but also all countries seeking to align their conduct within the limits of international law and justice can have clarity on the legal implications of Israels occupation and its policies and practices in the Palestinian occupied territories.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that over fifty countries have decided to participate in the proceedings concerning this advisory opinion.\n\nMr President, esteemed judges, the importance of the matter and the gravity of the situation in the Palestinian occupied territories were indisputable even before 7 October 2023. The tragic events of that date, and the disproportionate and indiscriminate military operations that followed, however, make it glaringly clear that the mere management of the conflict cannot be considered an option, and that a two-State solution, with an economically viable Palestinian State living side by side with Israel, is the only way to provide peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nWe know that the current request for an advisory opinion has a defined, restricted scope, excluding political considerations, as well as the legal definition of the events of 7 October and subsequent military operations. The consequences of these recent events notwithstanding, intrinsically linked to the Israeli occupation of Palestine, compels Brazil to mention them at this public hearing."

This Court, and the General Assembly, have expressly recognized that the existence of the Palestinian people, as much as their right to self-determination, is indisputable. Brazil would appreciate that the Court, within the scope of the present advisory opinion, could highlight the principled position that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories violates the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n\nIn 1967, Security Council resolution 242 emphasized the inadmissibility of acquiring territory by force and directed Israel to withdraw its troops from the then recently occupied Palestinian territory. However, the occupation persists to this day and has been aggravated by the construction of the separation wall in Palestinian territory, the building of illegal settlements in the West Bank and the annexation of East Jerusalem. As recognized by the Court in the Wall Advisory Opinion, Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power. The prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of Palestinian territories, including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of these territories, including Jerusalem, violate relevant rules of international law.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights foundational instruments of the international human rights protection system  guarantee the right of all individuals to be treated equally, without discrimination based on race, colour, gender or religion. By extending its jurisdiction over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and establishing two distinct legal systems one applied to Israeli settlers and another imposed, under military rule, to Palestinians Israel is practising discrimination against the Palestinian population, while impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. This differential treatment is evident and well documented and should also be addressed by the Court."

      "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
      "texto": "Moving to the first point, it is Chiles position that the Court has jurisdiction to give the requested advisory opinion and that there are no compelling reasons for the Court to refuse to do so.\n\nAs already stated in its written statements, Chile considers that the fact that a legal question may also involve certain political aspects or the fact that the parties concerned should pursue negotiations does not bar the Court from its jurisdiction. Indeed, complex situations, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are precisely the ones that can benefit the most from a clarification of the applicable law by this Court.\n\nWith regard to the principle of judicial propriety, which has been a matter of some debate in these proceedings, Chile underscores the fact that, by their very nature, advisory opinions do not resolve contentious disputes, and does not share the view of a few other States that rendering an advisory opinion in this case would be at odds with the agreed negotiation framework dealing with the ultimate status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nWhile it is true that the Security Council has endorsed a political process based on a negotiation framework for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is also true that the Security Council itself has condemned.\n\n“all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, including, inter alia, the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant resolutions”.\n\nChile recalls that this Court, in the Namibia Advisory Opinion, was clear in stating that an international instrument, such as a Security Council resolution, “has to be interpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation”. The Court has also noted that resolutions of the United Nations organs need to be analysed “having regard to the terms of the resolution to be interpreted, the discussions leading to it and, in general, all circumstances that might assist in determining the legal consequences of the resolution of the Security Council”.\n\nThus, to argue that Security Council resolutions supporting the need for a negotiated two-State solution impede the exercise of the Courts advisory jurisdiction is simply untenable. Indeed, it is quite clear from the language used by those resolutions and the discussions leading to their adoption, that any such negotiated solution precisely requires the cessation and non-recognition of Israels illegal activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It is difficult to understand how a legal opinion rendered by this Court, the purpose of which is precisely to determine the legal consequences of Israels behaviour in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, might be an obstacle for a prospective negotiated solution.\n\nIn addition, one should not lose sight of the fact that ongoing or prospective negotiations do not imply a suspension of the functions and powers of the Security Council or the General Assembly. Indeed, the purpose of the request for an advisory opinion in this case is precisely to assist the General Assembly in the exercise of its functions with regard to the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It is important to bear in mind that the General Assembly, in exercising its powers, can issue recommendations, the content of which is not restricted to calling the parties to agree on a negotiated solution.\n\nIn conclusion, Chile strongly supports the view that, by giving the requested advisory opinion, the Court will be acting within the scope of its advisory function, fulfilling its duty to provide the legal assistance that the General Assembly requires to exercise its power in the context of a long-standing conflict."

      "pregunta": "The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "In its first written submissions, Chile referred to some of the evidence before the Court which demonstrates that Israels policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Gaza, amount to serious and reiterated violations of international law, inter alia, of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, of the rules and basic principles of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law, including the prohibition of racial discrimination.Examining these violations is especially relevant in the present context of escalating hostilities. The upsurge of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Israel is partly explained by decades of systematic disregard of international law. Less than four months before the Hamas terrorist attacks, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson noted that Israels policies, including its attempts to exercise sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory “risks an uncontrollable explosion of violence on both sides”. The statement proved premonitory.\n\nNoting that the current escalation of hostilities is partly explained by the status quo does not entail condoning the attacks of Hamas. Chile unequivocally condemns terrorist actions and has called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages since day one. However, as noted by the United Nations Secretary-General, the escalation “does not come in a vacuum”, but grows out “of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year long occupation, and no political end in sight”. This further confirms the importance of determining the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violations of international law.\n\nAs Chile explained in its first written submission, there is vast evidence demonstrating the existence of serious violations of international law by Israel. Although Chile agrees with other States in noting that the Court does not need to make detailed findings on every incident mentioned throughout the submissions and in the more than 1,800 documents contained in the dossier filed by the Secretary-General, I would like to point to certain particularly serious violations which the Court should address in its advisory opinion.\n\nFirst, Israel has violated and continues to violate human rights law, including the denial of the Palestinian peoples self-determination, a norm of jus cogens nature118. The evidence is clear including the establishment and expansion of settlements, the confiscation of Palestinian land and arbitrary demolition of Palestinian houses, and the unwillingness and inability of Israeli authorities and officials to protect the Palestinian population from violence in breach of Israels obligations as an occupying Power. The Human Rights Committee the views of which have been given significant weight by the Court in the past regretted that “Palestinians have been systematically deprived of their land and housing rights for decades”, expressed concern for the “systematic practice of demolitions and forced evictions based on discriminatory policies” and noted that such practices “led to the separation of Jewish and Palestinian communities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which amounts to racial segregation”.\n\nThese violations have worsened after the October 7 attacks. Israeli human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) Yesh Din has noted that “2023 was the most violent year in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank in both the number of incidents and their severity”, and that the first two months after 7 October 2023 “were particularly violent”. Similar findings were made by Israeli NGO BTselem, Human Rights Watch and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also noted the rapid deterioration of the human rights situation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem after 7 October, including unnecessary and disproportionate use of force resulting in unlawful killing, mass arbitrary arrests, detentions and ill-treatment, and a further rise in settler violence, already at record-high levels. In parallel, high-ranking Israeli authorities have expressed that they have no intent to guarantee the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination in Gaza, by stating that “[t]he State of Israel will no longer be able to accept the existence of an independent entity in Gaza” and by calling for the re-settlement of the Strip.\n\nIsrael has not only violated the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination but also other rules of international law, including the jus ad bellum, by its de jure and de facto annexation of Palestinian territory. As developed in more detail in Chiles written submissions, and as eloquently put by former Special Rapporteur Lynk, “the inexorable Israeli occupation has become indistinguishable from annexation”. Chile agrees with the views of most participants in these proceedings, in noting that Israel neither regards itself nor behaves as a temporary occupant of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and that its practices and policies are inconsistent with a temporary administration of occupied territory.\n\nIsraels policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory also amount to serious violations of Israels obligations under international humanitarian law (including the prohibition of transferring civilian population into the occupied territory, which also amounts to a war crime), and under the rules of international human rights law, that forbid racial discrimination. This latter point has been repeatedly noted by authorities including the Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Special Rapporteurs, among others. In his 2023 Report to the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner documented “patterns of systematic discrimination in law, policy and practice, encompassing almost every sphere of life in particular, housing, land and property rights and the right to life, security of person and access to justice”. Already in 2019, the words of Prime Minister Netanyahu were crystal clear on this point: “Israel is not a State of all its citizens Israel is the nation State of the Jewish people and only it”.\n\nBefore moving to question, I want to note one additional feature of the abovementioned violations: Israel has incurred them in blatant disregard of repeated admonitions by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Court itself.\n\nFurthermore, as noted in February 2023 by the President of the Security Council, it is clear that Israels practices actually run contrary to the possibility of reaching a two-State solution and a sustainable peace in the region.These violations, among others, detailed in Chiles written statements, trigger Israels international responsibility. Thus, Israel is under the obligation to cease these violations, make full reparation and offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. These violations also impose on other States various related obligations, including the obligation to co-operate to bring this situation to an end through lawful means. Chile is precisely co-operating to bring this situation to an end by participating in these advisory proceedings, and by its joint submission with Mexico of a referral to the International Criminal Court on the situation in Palestine."

      "texto": "In addressing question (b), it is important to distinguish it clearly from question (a). As previously explained, question (a) is concerned with the legal consequences arising from the violation by Israel of various international law obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nThe second question is of a different nature. Question (b), focuses on the legal status of the occupation, that is to say, on the illegality of the occupation itself. In this regard, if the Court finds that the occupation is unlawful, it necessarily follows that the occupation must come to an end.\n\nThe conclusion that Israels occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal, lies on two grounds. First, there is ample evidence, as we have heard from States oral presentations during these two days, that the occupation has become an annexation. Second, the cumulative effect of the abovementioned systematic violations also requires the end of the occupation as the measure needed to effectively protect the rights of the Palestinians.\n\nWith regard to the legality of an occupation, the test put forward by former Special Rapporteur Lynk is particularly useful140. According to this test, the occupier cannot annex any of the occupied territory, the occupation must be temporary, and the occupant must seek to end the occupation and return the territory as soon as reasonably possible.\n\nThe de jure and de facto annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory by Israel contradicts the basic principle of no acquisition of territory by force. In this regard, General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) establishes that “[t]he territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force”; and that “[n]o territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”.\n\nThe principle of no acquisition of territory by force has been applied by this Court in relation to States, with regard to mandated territories, and in relation to peoples and their right to sovereignty and integrity of their national territory.\n\nThis Court has recognized that the territorial integrity is a key element for the exercise of the right of self-determination through which peoples freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social and cultural development. In fact, the Court in the Chagos Advisory Opinion has considered there is an intrinsic link between territorial integrity and self-determination, such that “any detachment, [or annexation like in this case,] by the administering Power of part of a non-self-governing territory, unless based on the freely expressed and genuine will of the people of the territory concerned, is contrary to the right to self-determination”.\n\nOccupation is often the result of armed conflict and, in so far as one of the main purposes of humanitarian law is to protect the civilian population that lives in areas affected by war, humanitarian law imposes various obligations upon the occupying Power, precisely to prevent the violation of their basic rights and the conquest of their territory.\n\nIn this context, Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contains an absolute prohibition of the annexation of occupied territories. In this case, the intention to annex the territory of the Palestinian people is demonstrated by the fact that the Israeli occupation has already expanded for a period of 56 years with no intention to put an end to it and with no satisfactory explanation as to the relation between occupation and the protection of its citizens. The policy and practice of settlements pursued by Israel since 1967 indicate its intention to claim that its own population has a right to stay permanently on these territories. Similarly, its exploitation of Palestinian natural resources also demonstrates Israels attempt to exercise sovereign powers over the Occupied Palestinian Territory. As an occupying Power, Israel is obligated to act as a temporary administrator on behalf of the protected population and as such it cannot destroy or appropriate these resources. However, the fact that it has completely sequestered them145 clearly shows that Israel does not conduct itself as a provisional occupying Power.\n\nIndeed, by virtue of its actions, including the exploitation of natural resources, the policies of settlements, the erection of the Wall, the legalization of outposts, among others, Israel has demonstrated its intention to control indefinitely the Occupied Palestinian Territory, hence, Israels occupation has become an annexation.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, turning now to the cumulative effects of the violation of self-determination, humanitarian law, human rights law and international criminal law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Chile contends that these systematic breaches are also a basis to declare that the occupation is illegal. Again, Special Rapporteur Lynks test is useful in this regard. According to this test146, the legality of an occupation requires the occupier to act in the best interests of the people under occupation and to administer the occupied territory in good faith, including acting in full compliance with the duties and obligations under international law.\n\nIt is important to clarify that not any violation of international law by an occupying Power leads to the conclusion that the occupation must come to an end. As was previously stated, occupation might be the result of an armed conflict and, in that context, it is the responsibility of the occupying Power to prevent and punish any act in breach of international law undertaken by its armed forces and persons under its control. In so far as the occupying State fulfils its duty to prevent and punish the individual perpetrators, the violations will not by themselves raise the question of the illegality of the occupation.\n\nBut in this case, the systematic violation of international law is part of a State policy, and then we think that the occupation has become illegal.\n\nTherefore, during this illegal occupation, the obligations of the occupying Power obviously persist, despite the fact that this occupation must come to an end."

      "texto": "First, on the matter of jurisdiction and competence, the small number of States objecting to the Courts exercise of jurisdiction have variously argued that the request is politically motivated, instrumentalizes the Court, circumvents the consent of Israel, covers too vast a scope or will prejudice the peace process and negotiations between the parties.\n\nLet me recall that the Court has repeatedly and consistently rejected such arguments. In the Kosovo Advisory Opinion, the Court did not concern itself with the motives which may have inspired the request or the political implications of its Opinion. Since the General Assembly is duly authorized under Article 96 of the United Nations Charter, and brought forth its request through a validly adopted resolution, the request, in the Courts own words, “in principle, should not be refused”. In the Nuclear Weapons and Chagos Advisory Opinions, the Court refused to secondguess the decision of the General Assembly, stating that it “has the right to decide for itself on the usefulness of an opinion in the light of its own needs”.\n\nDistinguished Members of the Court, the General Assembly has turned to this august Court with what is manifestly a legal question, seeking a legal answer that would indisputably assist in discharging its functions. Allow me to recall that this very Court in the Wall Opinion affirmed the United Nations “permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine” until such time as it may be “resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy”.\n\nIn the Wall Opinion, the Court found no merit in the proposition — echoed by some in these proceedings that the ongoing negotiations constituted a compelling reason to decline its competence. It reached a similar conclusion in the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, after noting that its opinion would “have relevance for the continuing debate on the matter in the General Assembly and would present an additional element on the matter”.\n\nIndeed, rather than prejudicing the peace process, the present advisory opinion serves not just as an “additional” element but rather an “essential” one for the General Assembly to continue to carry out its role in relation to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This is absolutely critical given the complete absence of any real prospect for a peaceful solution.\n\nThe Court could not possibly turn its back on this wealth of jurisprudence or disregard the many compelling reasons for it to honour the General Assemblys request, as summarized so aptly by the representative of Palestine. The Middle East region yearns for peace and stability and a just, comprehensive and lasting resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the principles of international law, and the establishment of a viable Palestinian State on the pre-1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The legal determination by the Court in the present advisory opinion is indispensable to guide the General Assembly and the international community to achieve this objective."

      "texto": "Second, Mr President, I turn to the question of the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. 14. Distinguished Members of the Court, Palestine has been subjected to the longest protracted state of occupation in modern history, as well as de facto and de jure annexation that confirm the unlawful nature of the occupation28. 15. Israels persistent policy of implanting settlements in the West Bank and occupied Jerusalem for the purpose of creating facts on the ground and breaking up the territorial contiguity of the occupied territories, is a blatant disregard for international law. Twenty years ago, the representatives of the State of Palestine laid before this Court the facts of Israels intensive settlement and colonization policy, which had, at the time, transferred 400,000 illegal settlers to the occupied Palestinian territories. Today, that number stands at 750,000, deliberately and permanently altering the status of the occupied territories. 16. In addition to the policy of de facto annexation, Israel purported to annex East Jerusalem de jure through the Basic Law adopted by the Israeli Knesset in 1980, stipulating “Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel”. 17. The very limited number of States defending these policies advance two principal claims, namely that “the legal status of occupation” does not change if the occupation is prolonged or involves illegal violations of jus in bello29 and that under jus ad bellum, Israeli occupation is lawful since, inter alia, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions did not declare otherwise.\n\nEgypt submits that the proposition that occupation is, merely, a de facto situation whose legality cannot be called into question is seriously flawed. As highlighted by a number of participants, the legality of an occupation must be assessed by reference to the United Nations Charter and general international law.\n\nIn fact, Israels prolonged occupation violates a number of distinct legal régimes that exist and operate simultaneously and concurrently. These include: the law of occupation, part of the jus in bello, that is characterized by this Court as “intransgressible”; the jus ad bellum and the peremptory prohibition of the acquisition of territory through force; the principle of self-determination, also a peremptory norm of international law, described by this Court as erga omnes and “irreproachable” in the East Timor case; and the fundamental prohibition of racial discrimination, segregation and subjugation.\n\nIt is against this legal framework that the legality of Israels policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories must be assessed.\n\nFirst, with respect to the jus in bello, it is a fundamental principle of international law that an occupying Power is prohibited from changing the status of the occupied territory, as well as its annexation, in whole or in part. It is only entitled to exercise limited powers, intended to be temporary in nature, with the aim of balancing between its own military needs and the protection of the local inhabitants. These are not rights bestowed on the occupying Power, but rather limitations on its authority.\n\nIt flows from this that belligerent occupation is governed by two key principles. First, it is a temporary régime and, second, it cannot transfer sovereignty to the occupying Power. Rather, it freezes the legal order of the occupied territory throughout the duration of the occupation. The occupying authority is merely a de facto administrator, a principle intended to protect both the inhabitants of the occupied territory, as well as “the separate existence of the State, its institutions and its laws”. This is reflected in Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and is precisely what “distinguishes occupation from annexation”.\n\nThe prohibition of permanently changing the occupied territory extends also to its demographic component. Article 49 of the Fourth Convention prohibits “individual or mass forcible transfer” of civilians outside the occupied territory; and the transfer by the occupying Power of “parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. According to the 1958 Commentary, this was intended “to prevent a practice adopted during the Second World War by certain Powers, which transferred portions of their own population to occupied territory for political and racial reasons or in order, as they claimed, to colonize those territories”.\n\nAs demonstrated in Palestines statement, there is overwhelming evidence that Israeli support for and maintenance of settlements is intended to permanently alter the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and extend Israeli sovereignty over it. This is coupled with Israels mass forcible transfer and forced displacement of the Palestinians in Gaza, through its illegal evacuation orders and indiscriminate use of force, which has been labelled by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as “ethnic cleansing”.\n\nIt should be highlighted that Article 49 not only prohibits forced transfers, but also, in the Courts own words, “any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory”.\n\nNumerous resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council affirmed the illegality of Israels settlements, annexation and measures altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem considering them invalid and a flagrant violation of the Fourth Convention, while requiring Israel to desist from such practices38.\n\nSecurity Council resolution 298 stated that “all legislative and administrative actions taken by Israel to change the status of the City of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section, are totally invalid and cannot change that status”.\n\nThe Security Council also declared in relation to Jerusalem in resolution 478 (1980) that Israeli “legislative and administrative measures are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith”. Israel remains in defiance of these and subsequent resolutions, including resolution 2334 (2016) and numerous General Assembly resolutions in addition to the provisions of the Geneva Conventions previously described.\n\nIsraels prolonged military rule and its strategic settlement policy, considered a “national value” under Israeli legislation, is essentially a systemic “de-Palestinianization” of the occupied territory, including Jerusalem, intended to permanently change its demographic characteristics, and enhance its Jewish component, thereby achieving the de jure and de facto annexation of that territory. This leads to the conclusion that Israeli occupation is, in fact, an illegal annexation, conquest and de facto colonial endeavour.\n\nMr President, the second legal principle by which the legality of Israels occupation is to be assessed, is Article 2 (4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibits the acquisition of territory through force; one of the most fundamental principles of the post-UN Charter era.\n\nThe vast majority of States participating in these proceedings submit that Israeli occupation by virtue of its permanence, de jure and de facto annexation manifestly violates the principle of inadmissibility of acquiring territory through force. Only one State has attempted to justify Israels actions, by contesting the Palestinians title to the occupied territories and justifying Israels territorial expansion as the product of a defensive war43.\n\nEgypt submits that these claims have no basis in fact or in law and seek to derail the Court by raising issues outside the temporal scope of this request. They are reminiscent of the archaic international law of the nineteenth century that justified territorial conquest through denying the sovereign status of colonized peoples, relegating them to the realm of terra nullius.\n\nThere is, also, no support for the proposition that Israel was acting defensively in 1967. International law recognizes neither pre-emptive nor preventive self-defence and the terms of the United Nations Charter on this matter are clear, requiring an armed attack to occur in order to trigger the right of self-defence. Israels attack in 1967 was, therefore, not a defensive but an aggressive war.\n\nEven if the claim of self-defence were valid — which clearly is not the case — a decades-long occupation is not reconcilable with the customary international law conditions of necessity, immediacy and proportionality44. In any event, the issue is a moot one, as it is universally recognized that a State may not gain title to territory through any use of force, regardless of its purported legitimacy.\n\nThese claims also find no basis in Security Council resolution 242, which unequivocally recognized the inadmissibility of acquiring territory through force, demanding Israels withdrawal from territories occupied in the recent conflict and emphasizing the duty of all States to act in accordance with Article 2 of the Charter. Resolution 242 was reaffirmed by resolution 338, while the inadmissibility of territorial acquisition through force was confirmed in at least nine subsequent Security Council resolutions. In fact, resolution 471 clearly stated, as far back as 1980, the overriding necessity to end the prolonged occupation of the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 including Jerusalem.\n\nIn Egypts view, it is clear that under international law, the territorial status of the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip cannot lawfully be altered through armed conflict.\n\nIsraels protracted occupation, which is coupled with measures to permanently change the demographic characteristics of the occupied territory, and annex parts of the land de facto and de jure in violation of the cardinal principle of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory through force, is therefore, illegal per se and an ongoing violation of international law."

Its erga omnes character, confirmed by the Court in the East Timor case, entails that all States and international organizations have a legal interest and a duty in respecting and protecting this right.\n\nThis Court already affirmed in the Wall Advisory Opinion the applicability of this right to the “Palestinian people”.\n\nMr President, Israels indefinite occupation of the Palestinian territories is as a whole inconsistent with the principle of self-determination and breaches three salient aspects of this principle. First, it obstructs the Palestinian people from freely determining their political status, achieving independent statehood, sovereignty and the right of return.\n\nSecond, it deprives Palestinians of their right to pursue their economic, social and cultural development. In gross breach of international law, Israel restricts Palestinians access to Jerusalems Christian and Muslim holy sites, notably Al-Aqsa Mosque, wantonly depletes Palestinian natural resources, imposes access restrictions to “Area C” and obstructs the movement of goods and people between the West Bank and Gaza, stunting Palestines economy and impeding the geographical unity of the State of Palestine.\n\nThird, the fragmentation and dismemberment of the occupied territories, through Israels settlements policy, the wall and measures of de facto and de jure annexation, are a blatant violation of the fundamental principle of the integrity of the self-determination unit. The territorial unit of Palestine includes both the West Bank, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Although Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005, it still retains effective control by, inter alia: exercising complete control over Gazas airspace and territorial waters; the flow of people and goods in and out of Gaza; the Palestinian population registry; and the tax policy and transfer of tax revenues. Israels continuing military incursions into Gaza, including the ongoing brutal assault, indicate Israels continuing authority over the territory. Together, the West Bank and Gaza constitute a single territorial unit. This has been confirmed by numerous Security Council resolutions which refer to Gaza as an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 and of the Palestinian State under the two-State solution.\n\nEgypt firmly denounces the ongoing obstruction of the Palestinian peoples inalienable, permanent and unqualified right to self-determination, a violation — as argued by Palestine — that is an “essential feature” of Israels prolonged occupation.\n\nOne only needs to look at Israels vicious, wholesale destruction of Gaza today, after years of imposing the medieval methods of siege and blockade, to realize the extent of Israels transgression of this principle. Israels prolonged occupation is therefore illegal, per se, and is an ongoing, internationally wrongful act that must be immediately brought to an end by Israel, by immediately ending the occupation.\n\nThe fourth legal principle against which Israels conduct must be assessed is the fundamental prohibition of racial discrimination, segregation and subjugation.\n\nOn a daily basis, under occupation, Palestinians face institutionalized discrimination and segregation under a dual legal system, applying different laws to Palestinians and Israelis. Israeli military orders in the occupied territories entrench racial discrimination between Palestinians and Israeli settlers. Israel also implements de facto and de jure measures of racial discrimination, including in the areas of detention, criminal justice, housing, land confiscations and house demolitions. How can such practices — which have been described by a number of participants as “crimes against humanity” — how can they be consistent with any notion of human rights and human dignity in the 21st century?\n\nIsrael is under an obligation to repeal all such legislation that maintains its systematic, oppressive and institutionalized policy of racial discrimination and segregation against the Palestinian people, and to cease all discriminatory policies and practices.\n\nI now turn to whether self-defence or military necessity may justify Israels prolonged occupation.\n\nThe argument that a State may exercise self-defence against a territory under its own military occupation and effective control is counter-intuitive, particularly since the occupying State has the authority and even the obligation to “ensure public order and safety” in the occupied territory.\n\nIn the Wall Advisory Opinion, this Court found that Article 51 of the Charter, which recognizes the inherent right of self-defence, had no relevance, as the acts invoked by Israel were acts arising out of the occupied Palestinian territory, which is under Israeli effective control and not imputable to another State. Egypt finds no reason for the Court to depart from this considered Opinion in the current proceedings.\n\nThe Court also rejected the justification of military necessity. The modern conception of military necessity is strictly limited to the contexts in which it is expressly recognized. It is thus already considered in the formulation of the obligations set out in humanitarian conventions, some of which “expressly exclude reliance on military necessity”.\n\nFor example, no military necessity qualification is permitted under Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the transfer of any part of the occupying Powers civilian population into an occupied territory. This cannot be justified as a safety measure taken by Israel in the exercise of its prerogatives as an occupying Power.\n\nAccording to the legal maxim ex injuria jus non oritur, one should not be able to profit from ones own wrongdoing. Israel thus cannot invoke self-defence to maintain a situation created by its own illegal conduct, or to justify violations of peremptory norms of international law.\n\nDistinguished Members of the Court, for how much longer do the Palestinian people need to wait before they are able to exercise their legitimate rights under international law? For how much longer will the United Nations continue to manage the humanitarian impacts of Israeli violations, without addressing their root cause? History will judge us for how we respond today.\n\nEgypt respectfully submits that the Court should advise the General Assembly that: the prolonged Israeli occupation is, per se, a continuing violation of international law for its breach of: the jus in bello; the prohibition of the acquisition of territory through force; the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; and the prohibition of racial discrimination, segregation and subjugation.\n\nIsrael — as the wrongdoing State is obliged to make full reparation through restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, by ceasing immediately and unconditionally its unlawful occupation of Palestinian territory, and rescinding the associated unlawful policies and practices of annexation, settlements and discriminatory legislation.\n\nAll States have a duty not to recognize the illegal situation created by Israels ongoing violation, resulting from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the occupied territory, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.\n\nMr President, the consequences of Israels prolonged occupation are clear, and there can be no peace, no security, no stability, no prosperity in the Middle East, without upholding justice and the rule of law for the Palestinian people. I thank you."

      "texto": "By virtue of Article 65, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, two requirements must be met for the Court to have jurisdiction to give an opinion: there must be a formal request from a body duly authorized by the United Nations Charter, or in accordance to it, to make such a request, and the question put before the Court must be a legal question.\n\nIt is undisputed that the General Assembly is one of the bodies authorized to make such a request, in line with Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter and that the decision of the General Assembly to submit the questions contained in resolution 77/247 was adopted in accordance with its rules of procedure and by the required majority. A significant number of Member States — including Colombia — decided it was important for the General Assembly to receive guidance on the questions put to the Court. Therefore, the request observes the first requirement.\n\nThe second requirement, namely that the question put before the Court be a legal one, is also complied within the present case. Indeed, in your jurisprudence, particularly, for example, in the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, you have clarified that a question is a legal one when “the Court is asked to rule on the compatibility of the [request] with the relevant principles and rules of international law”. In other words, questions “framed in terms of law and rais[ing] problems of international law”, whereby the Court is asked to identify and apply principles and rules of international law, qualify as questions of a legal character.\n\nColombia considers that the questions raised in resolution 77/247 are indeed framed in legal terms, since they request the Court to determine the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of the State of Israel, a Member State of the United Nations, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to ascertain how those actions affect the legal status of the occupation. Those questions are to be answered through the application of rules of international law and therefore constitute legal questions which could form the basis of a request for an advisory opinion.\n\nThus, in the opinion of Colombia, the Court has jurisdiction to respond to the questions contained in resolution 77/247."

      "pregunta": "Decides to comply with the request for an advisory opinion",
      "texto": "Mr President, I will now focus on the question of propriety. In this respect, while Article 65, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, gives the Court discretionary power to give or not an advisory opinion that has been requested from it, in its case law the Court clarified certain important points, namely:\n\nthat the Court may give an advisory opinion should be interpreted to mean that the Court has always a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion, even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met; and the Court is always mindful of the fact that its answer to a request for an advisory opinion represents its participation in the activities of the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused.\n\nWhile certain States have expressed opposition to the request by the General Assembly, the reasons argued are, for the most part, quite similar to those dismissed by the Court in its Advisory Opinion on the Construction of a Wall. In that case the Court decided to render the requested Opinion as, in its own words “[d]ifferences of views on legal issues have existed in practically every advisory proceeding”.\n\nColombia posits that the Courts thorough reasoning then, soundly grounded on its long-standing jurisprudence, is directly applicable to the current request.\n\nConsequently, Colombia considers that the Court should reach the same conclusion in the present proceedings, that is, that it can and will exercise jurisdiction, and that there are no compelling reasons for it to use its discretionary power not to render an opinion.\n\nHence, Colombia invites the Court to pronounce the law on the legal consequences arising out of serious breaches of peremptory norms of general international law and thus assist the General Assembly in the proper exercise of its functions; the United Nations in discharging its responsibilities in this matter, originating, as the Court recalled, in the Mandate and the Partition resolution concerning Palestine; and all States who possess an interest in the protection of erga omnes obligations.\n\nMr President, an additional important circumstance that should be factored in by the Court when deciding as to the propriety of rendering its advisory opinion is that the situation in the Palestinian occupied territory has changed drastically since the request was transmitted to the Court in January 2023.\n\nOn 7 October of the same year Israel was the victim of a horrifying attack by Hamas. We all know the scale and the magnitude of Israels reaction to the attack. The Court itself has already been confronted with the veritable map of horror and devastation which the Gaza Strip has become, as a result of the total war and scorched-earth policies unleashed by the Government of Israel.\n\nIndeed, in several passages of its Order of 26 January concerning provisional measures in the case brought by South Africa against Israel on 29 December 2023, the Court took judicial notice of some details of this dire situation. To quote just one of such passages, in the Courts own words:\n\n“The Court considers that the civilian population in the Gaza Strip remains extremely vulnerable. It recalls that the military operation conducted by Israel after 7 October 2023 has resulted, inter alia, in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries and the destruction of homes, schools, medical facilities and other vital infrastructure, as well as displacement on a massive scale The Court notes that the operation is ongoing and that the Prime Minister of Israel announced on 18 January 2024 that the war ‘will take many more long months. At present, many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have no access to the most basic foodstuffs, potable water, electricity, essential medicines or heating.”\n\nEvidently, the factual matrix of that case and the background of these advisory proceedings are not identical and, in particular, the request by the General Assembly has a wider scope than South Africas Application in at least two respects: in that the requested advisory opinion refers to the policies and practices of Israel in the whole Palestinian Occupied Territory and not only in the Gaza Strip; and in that it covers all actions that Israel carries out in such territory and not only the actions and omissions by State agents that, according to the Applicant in the contentious case, amount to genocide.\n\nBut the point remains that those policies and practices — which in Colombias view contravene essential norms of international law — have taken a turn for the worse as a result of Israels military campaign unfolding in Gaza, today a place of death and despair that, in the words of an impartial source, “has simply become uninhabitable”.\n\nColombia respectfully submits that the Court should not underestimate the fact that the situation in Gaza has become more deadly over the past months and, therefore, the legal consequences of such actions must be even more serious today than in the world we were living before this bloodshed started.\n\nAgainst that distressing background, and for all the reasons explained above, the Government of Colombia, in line with its policy of pursuing Total Peace both within and beyond its borders, calls upon the Court to avail itself of the opportunity to clarify legal aspects that may pave the way for the parties to resume a fruitful discussion and achieve peace, and support the General Assembly to better assist them in that purpose."

      "texto": "Mr President, let me address now the questions submitted to the Court by the General Assembly. The questions relate to the legal consequences arising from Israels ongoing violation of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people as a result of its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, and for all States and the United Nations from this ongoing occupation.\n\nIn order for the Court to rule on those questions, it must first determine whether Israel is violating the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, and whether Israels prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory since 1967 is in violation of international law. An answer in the affirmative to both questions will then enable the Court to address the ensuing legal consequences.\n\nWith regard to the first issue, as mentioned, in the Wall Advisory Opinion the Court stated that Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and, in doing so, it is obliged to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law. The General Assembly routinely reaffirms such right by means of an annual resolution on the matter.\n\nRegarding the second point, Israels prolonged occupation and further annexation of the Palestinian territory is in manifest violation of the rule of international customary law which clearly prohibits the acquisition of territory by force. It also blatantly ignores the United Nations Charter and the findings of this Court in its Advisory Opinion on the Wall case.\n\nAn occupation that includes the annexation de facto of the occupied territory amounts, in Colombias view, to an illegal acquisition of territory by use or threat of force, and to a denial of the right of self-determination. Furthermore, the occupation violates peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, as the Court recalled in its 2004 Advisory Opinion, Israels policies and practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are contrary to the terms of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party.\n\nGiven that the Israeli occupation has since its onset been acquisitive in nature and, consequently, its policies and practices in furtherance of that occupation have resulted in imposed persecution, racial discrimination and apartheid over the Palestinian people, it can only be found to be in breach of various international legal obligations incumbent upon Israel."

      "texto": "Mr President, with regard to the consequences of those violations, Colombia is of the view that Israels actions contrary to international law engage its responsibility and therefore entail distinct legal consequences.\n\nFirst of all, Israel is obliged to cease its violations and to return to a situation of compliance with the obligations it has breached. Consequently, Israel is bound to put an end to the prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory. It must do so unconditionally, immediately and completely. It must cease the continuing internationally wrongful acts, and should offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. Israel also must respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law vis-à-vis the Palestinian people.\n\nMoreover, Israel must make reparations for the damage caused. The Courts jurisprudence on the essential forms of reparation in customary law is clear. Israel likewise has an obligation to compensate, in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal persons having suffered any form of material or immaterial damage as a result of its occupation upon the Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael also has violated erga omnes obligations, and as the Court indicated in the Barcelona Traction case, such obligations are by their very nature “the concern of all States” and “in view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection.”\n\nGiven the character and the importance of the rights and obligations involved, it follows that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the occupation of the Palestinian territory. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such occupation. As the Court has asserted, “it is also for all States, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to see to it that any impediment to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end.”\n\nFinally, Colombia believes that States must co-operate within the multilateral framework of the United Nations. In the present situation, the Organization, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further and urgent action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting, in the instant request, from Israels illegal occupation. The Courts guidance is crucial for that purpose."

In this regard, the Republic of Cuba believes that, rather than an obvious apartheid régime situation, prosecuted as a crime against humanity, this is indeed an act of low-intensity genocide that is perpetrated with systematic and effective cruelty. To qualify Israels actions merely as acts of apartheid would leave out the implicit intention to exterminate the Palestinian people, either in part or as an ethnic and religious group to whom the right to self-determination is denied.\n\nIn case there was any doubt about the arguments that Cuba presented to the Court in its brief, the current situation that is taking place in the eyes of all confirms the ongoing genocide.\n\nInnocent victims, girls, boys, women, civilians in general, number in the thousands.\n\nFor the Genocide Convention to apply, the life of one single victim, or the incitement, attempt or conspiracy to commit such acts would be enough.\n\nThe Convention against Genocide also punishes the accomplices and instigators; those who veto decisions and prevent the international community and the United Nations from taking action; those who oppose an immediate ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid; those who, for years, have supported each and every one of the policies and practices of Israel, the occupying Power, which deny the existence of the Palestinian people and their rights. This agenda, to a large extent, has advanced in the course of time.\n\nWe are convinced that this Court should not wait for the complete extermination of an entire nation before ruling on the matter. That was the intention of the United Nations General Assembly in requesting the advisory opinion.\n\nThe terrible situation currently facing the Palestinian people is a reminder of the urgency of a clear and consistent statement on the questions submitted to the consideration of the Court.\n\nIsrael, the occupying Power, and its allies, must take responsibility for the legal implications resulting from the sustained non-compliance with the international law.\n\nConsequently, the analysis of the international responsibility of Israel should go hand in hand with the responsibility of the United Nations and the Member States that hinder its actions, creating by sustained and continued omission an international wrongful act that aggravates and worsens a clear situation of violation of international law in the Palestinian occupied territories.\n\nThere should be a clear and unanimous ruling by the Court that impartially and independently establishes the legal implications resulting from depriving the Palestinian peoples from their fundamental rights, including the right to life, freedom and self-determination."

These agreements state that “no party shall commence or take any step that would modify the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, pending the outcome of negotiations on the permanent status”.\n\nThe destruction and appropriation of property in occupied territories, which are not justified by military necessity and are carried out on a large scale, unlawfully and arbitrarily, constitute grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and therefore constitute a war crime.\n\nThe Palestinian question demands a clear statement on the legal implications resulting from the non-applicability and violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nLand, sea and air blockades constitute collective punishment and are extreme violations of freedom of movement and the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nCollective punishment is expressly prohibited by international humanitarian law and is incompatible with several international human rights law provisions.\n\nThe written submission presented by Cuba to this Court provides well-documented evidence, particularly the serious violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n\nThe genocide against the Palestinian people is not limited to the current stage of the extermination war by Israel. All this with the complicity of the United States of America, which prevents the international community from acting to protect the Palestinian people. The justifications for fighting terrorism and exercising the right to self-defence are deceitful when they are raised by the aggressors themselves.\n\nThe legal consequences of current and past events should not be analysed in a fragmented manner.\n\nTaken as a whole, this institutionalized violence, which makes no distinction between civilians and combatants, is part of a broader policy that also includes, in a systematic and organized manner: massive confiscations of land and property, unlawful killings, extrajudicial executions, torture, administrative detentions, forced transfers, restrictions on movement and the denial of nationality and citizenship to the Palestinian population.\n\nThere is also a discriminatory economic and cultural policy aimed at impoverishing the Palestinian population and denying the realization of their fundamental human rights."

Just yesterday, the United States vetoed for the 48th time a Security Council resolution related to the Palestinian question.\n\nThe International Court of Justice should emphasize the scope of Article 2.5 of the United Nations Charter, which states that all Members “shall refrain from giving assistance to any State against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action”.\n\nThis entails the obligation of all States to abide by the decisions adopted by the Organization as a whole, particularly when the Security Council remains passive by the indolent attitude of one of its permanent members, the United States of America, and the United Nations General Assembly has continuously and categorically taken a stand on this question, supported by the International Court of Justice."

This vision necessarily includes the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian State, as reaffirmed most recently by the Security Council in resolution 2720 of 22 December 2023.\n\nThe viability of this vision of peace and of an independent Palestinian State are imperilled by Israeli violations that are the subject of the present proceedings. Since the General Assemblys request to the Court in December 2022, these violations and the level of violence have risen sharply.\n\nWe convene today while Israels grave violations against Palestinians persist with impunity, four months into its military operation in Gaza and following four failures by the Security Council to call for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, an increasingly brutal Israeli régime of systemic subjugation in the West Bank compounds Palestinian suffering. The horrors that have unfolded over the last few months, the 7 October attack on Israel, the destruction of the Gaza Strip, and the oppression in the West Bank underscore the desperate need for realizing the two-State solution. In the context of this grim reality, the Courts advisory opinion is appropriate, it is urgent, and it is necessary.\n\nFar from prejudicing the negotiating framework, the Courts opinion will reinforce the contours of the two-State solution. Indeed, that solution must be consistent with international law. In the Wall Opinion, the Court recognized that a negotiated solution and the establishment of a Palestinian State, alongside Israel, must be on the basis of international law57. This is also what the Security Council reaffirmed most recently in resolution 2720.\n\nThese pronouncements make clear that a negotiating process could not, and must not, lead to a result that is contrary to international law. And it is self-evident that a negotiating process that results in the contravention of peremptory norms of general international law would be void. By their very nature peremptory norms are non-negotiable. The fact that a solution is negotiated does not mean that it should not be principled.\n\nBy responding to the questions posed by the General Assembly as regards Israels violations and their consequences, the Court will be advising on legal questions directly relevant to the two-State solution. In so doing, the Court will aid efforts to realize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. This could not be more pressing.\n\nMoreover, as the State of Palestine observed in its oral statement on Monday60, the Courts exercise of its advisory function can and has served to advance deadlocked negotiations, as occurred with its Chagos Opinion. There is a similar need for the Courts advice on the Palestinian question, which is characterized by prolonged stalemate and frustrated negotiations while Israel continues to change facts on the ground."

The UAE is confident that the Court has before it ample evidence to assist its identification of those violations and determination of their legal consequences. As I turn to my second point, I will outline briefly how the situation has severely deteriorated since July 2023.\n\nUnder international law, the Gaza Strip is occupied territory61. Gaza is also one of the most densely populated places on Earth.\n\nFor over four months now, and after enduring 17 years of blockade, its population of over 2.2 million has been under siege, faced with severe restrictions on water, food and other essential goods. The level of human suffering faced by civilians in Gaza, predominantly women and children, is on a scale seldom seen in the modern era.\n\nIsraels indiscriminate attacks on the Gaza Strip have caused massive civilian casualties and the extensive destruction of homes, schools and hospitals. Some 75 per cent of Gazas total population is displaced. I note here, Mr President, the latest orders issued to the Israeli Defense Forces to plan for the evacuation of Rafah ahead of another military offensive. That offensive would leave the approximately 1.5 million displaced Gazans taking refuge in the city with nowhere to go. These plans have been met with the international communitys resounding rejection.\n\nIsrael has imposed a policy of collective punishment against the Palestinian people, in violation of Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel has repeatedly issued so-called evacuation orders that in effect seek to transfer Palestinians forcibly, in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nIsrael has also failed its duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population in Gaza, in violation of Article 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel has further failed to protect the wounded and the sick, in violation of Article 16 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nEach passing day is met with further violations of international humanitarian law.\n\nAnd while the eyes of the world are trained on its brutal military operation in Gaza, Israels violations in the West Bank have intensified. As submitted to the Court, a number of Israeli acts in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, constitute grave breaches under the Fourth Geneva Convention62. Israels conduct also violates the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which lies at the heart of these proceedings63.\n\n2023 was by far the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since the United Nations began keeping records — more than tripling the previous high in 202264.\n\n2023 also saw the highest levels of settler violence yet recorded by the United Nations65. The freedom of movement of Palestinians has been severely impacted, including for Palestinian farmers seeking to harvest their lands in the West Bank66. Demolitions of Palestinian property have also reached their highest levels. This puts into stark relief the magnitude of this latest iteration of the Israeli settlement enterprise that erodes key components of the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination, including the denial of access to ancestral lands and control over natural resources.\n\nIn addition, there has been an intensification of Israeli settlement construction that undermines the viability of the two-State solution. According to the Secretary-General, 2023 saw the highest reported level of Israeli approvals and support for settler housing in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\n\nI raise these recent developments to underline that the violations at the core of the questions posed by the General Assembly are not static. After decades of violent dehumanization, dispossession and despair, the breaches resulting from the Israeli occupation in all parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory are worsening at an alarming pace.\n\nI will now focus on Israels long-standing violations in East Jerusalem."

      "texto": ". Jerusalem is “a city of unique cultural and religious depth and texture” that has occupied, through history, a place “at the crossroads of cultures and civilizations”.\n\nThe City of Jerusalem has the unique feature of being sacred for all three Abrahamic religions and is home to a host of Holy Places. This feature has put a special imprint on the citys character. And the international community has accordingly underlined the need to preserve Jerusalems unique spiritual and religious dimensions.\n\nIf Jerusalem has throughout its long history represented one thing, it is tolerance. In the words of UNESCO, “[m]ore than any other place in the world, Jerusalem embodies the hope and dream of dialogue between cultures, civilizations and spiritual traditions, a dialogue through which mutual understanding between peoples may flourish”. Such is the unique historical nature of Jerusalem that an Israeli official once cautioned that “[a]nyone depriving Jerusalem of these contrasts, anyone upsetting the equilibrium by trying to make one factor predominant over another would make Jerusalem cease to be herself”.\n\nJerusalem is a place of enormous significance to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. On account of their artistic, religious and historical value, the Old City and the Holy Places are of exceptional importance to all humanity.\n\nJerusalems unique character has given rise to specific legal obligations as regards the rights of religious communities, including “specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places”. Since 1757, it has been the case that whoever holds Jerusalem is bound by this legal and historic status quo.\n\nAs early as 1948, the Security Council urged all governments and authorities concerned “to take every possible precaution for the protection of the Holy Places and of the City of Jerusalem, including access to all shrines and sanctuaries for the purpose of worship”. The concerns that motivated the Council then still remain. In 2023, the Security Council called “for upholding unchanged the historic status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem in word and in practice”.\n\nIsrael has, in agreements with Jordan and with the Holy See, committed to the historic status quo and freedom of access to the Holy Places in Jerusalem. In the Wall Opinion, the Court relied on such bilateral agreements, observing that they were part of the specific guarantees of access to Holy Places.\n\nIt is therefore gravely disconcerting that Israel has taken, and continues to take, measures which undermine the special character of Jerusalem and erase its cultural heritage.\n\nIsrael is in breach of its obligations by repeatedly interfering with the Holy Places and hindering freedom of access to them. Since the start of the occupation in 1967, Muslims and Christians have been impeded from worshipping at their holiest sites.\n\nAlso in breach of the historic status quo are Israels excavations in Jerusalem. Excavations and tunnelling, particularly in and around the Old City, imperil its historical, cultural and religious character.The works are carried out despite the serious risks to the integrity of Muslim and Christian Holy Places. The General Assembly has determined that these acts are flagrant violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nTurning to the question of settlements, the “ring” settlements in East Jerusalem contribute to “the further isolation of the city from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory”. They thereby undermine the viability of East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestinian State. This is fast becoming a fait accompli.\n\nMr President, Israels measures to extend its administration and laws to East Jerusalem are inconsistent with the most fundamental tenets of the law of occupation and the right to self-determination. Indeed, Israels administration of East Jerusalem constitutes annexation of territory on which the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination. International law is unequivocal in this respect: all measures by Israel that affect or aim to alter the status of East Jerusalem are null and void and have no legal effect on its status.\n\nBy resolution 478 of 1980, the Security Council affirmed that Israels enactment of the Basic Law was a violation of international law. Resolution 478 was plainly intended to be legally binding on Israel and all United Nations Member States. A binding determination by the Security Council to the effect that a situation is illegal must have consequences. As the Court noted in the Namibia opinion, “it would be failing in the discharge of its judicial functions if it did not declare that there is an obligation to bring [such a] situation to an end”.\n\nIsraels violations in East Jerusalem and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory threaten the viability of the two-State solution and go to the very nature of the occupation.\n\nIt is in this context that I come to the legality of the occupation itself. The Security Council reaffirmed in 1980 “the overriding necessity for ending the prolonged occupation of Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967”. The General Assembly has declared that “the Arab territories occupied since 1967 have continued to be under illegal Israeli occupation”.\n\nIsraels occupation is — as the vast majority of participants in these proceedings have recognized — illegal and must end. Israels occupation breaches the requirement, under the law of occupation, that an occupation must be temporary and cannot become permanent. It is in breach of the cardinal principle, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, that the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible. Israels occupation furthermore violates peremptory norms of general international law, such as the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination. Mr President, whether the illegality of Israels occupation is determined under general international law or under the Charter, the conclusion is the same: it is illegal.\n\nIsraels illegal acts cannot remain without consequence. Which takes me to my last point."

      "texto": "Mr President, distinguished Members of the Court, I will now address the legal consequences of the ongoing violations by Israel.\n\nI wish to draw the Courts attention to the obligations identified by the Court in the Chagos and Wall Opinions. First, Israel has, inter alia, an obligation to comply with the primary obligations it has breached; an obligation to ensure cessation of those breaches; and an obligation to make reparation for the damage caused by those breaches. Let me illustrate these obligations with a few examples.\n\nThis means that Israel must cease all policies and practices impeding the exercise of the Palestinian right to self-determination and repeal all laws and regulations that aim to alter the demographic composition, character and status of East Jerusalem. It also means that Israel must ensure freedom of access to the Holy Places and respect the legal and historic status quo.\n\nThis means that Israel must comply with all its obligations as the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. For example, Israel must bring into the Gaza Strip the necessary food and medical supplies to the Palestinian population, and it must end its siege and all practices depriving Palestinians of supplies essential to their survival. In practical terms, it must mean a ceasefire.\n\nIt also means that Israel must stop its so-called evacuation orders and forcible transfers of Palestinians. It means that Israel must dismantle settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and must prevent violence perpetrated by settlers — many of them armed — against Palestinians. And it means that Israel must put an end to its settlement activities, its confiscation of land, demolition of homes, and the transfer of new Israeli settlers to the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nFinally, Israel must also comply with all decisions of the Security Council, in line with Article 25 of the United Nations Charter. This includes the binding decisions in resolutions 478, 2334, 2712 and 2720."

First, no State may recognize as lawful the situation resulting from Israels unlawful conduct nor render assistance to maintain such a situation. Second, States are under an obligation to co-operate to bring to an end Israels serious breaches. Additionally, States parties to the Geneva Conventions must ensure respect for those Conventions.\n\nThese obligations may translate into different actions from one State to another. The UAE believes that diplomatic engagement and dialogue can be effective tools to encourage compliance and cessation of unlawful conduct. But where these tools fail, third States obligations remain, as do the other instruments of the international system, including the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Court that sits in this Great Hall of Justice.\n\nAs the Permanent Representative of a country that has just completed its term on the Security Council, I wish to invite the Court to consider the following: the obligations to co-operate and to ensure respect for international law carry implications for States in the exercise of their vote on the Security Council. Voting against or preventing the adoption of a Security Council resolution that seeks to put an end to serious breaches of international law cannot be compatible with such obligations.\n\nIsraels violations also have implications for international organizations. The organs of the United Nations can and should take all steps within their respective mandates with a view to ensuring an end to those violations. The UAE remains firmly committed to play its part in supporting the principles of international law which underpin the international system.\n\nThe UAE considers that the Courts advice on the questions before it is critical. Indeed, we believe it matters for all States — large and small — who rely upon and seek to preserve our international order. The reason it matters is quite simple: the even-handed application of international law is essential if that order is to function. To allow otherwise, to permit States to pick and choose what international law to apply and when, risks destabilizing our international order."

      "texto": "Bangladesh has long reiterated the call to end Israels occupation of Palestine and to achieve a lasting and permanent solution, which entails the establishment of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State along the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We firmly believe that the Court must heed the long overdue call to holistically examine Israels occupation and render an opinion on the legal status of the occupation as a whole. /n/nThe ongoing war represents one of the most shameful catastrophes in the history of the modern era. The United Nations agencies and other humanitarian aid organizations on the ground have warned of a “humanitarian disaster” engulfing the tiny enclave of 2.3 million people, with shortages of food, fuel, drinking water and medicines, worsening by the day. The killing of thousands of innocent civilians, particularly children, the destruction of their homes, the occupation of their ancestral lands and the deliberate obstruction of their access to food and water all constitute blatant violations of international law and serve as textbook examples of ethnic cleansing. /n/nWe elaborated on these matters and the underlying reasoning in our submissions before the Court, Mr President, on 24 July and 25 October last year. It is pertinent to recall that, just four months back, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, in her report, brought up several appalling facts. I would consider it apt to quote one pertinent aspect: “[I]n the occupied Palestinian territory, the fundamental right to life is under threat, as indicated by the mortality rates of Palestinian children: the neonatal mortality and infant mortality rates in the occupied Palestinian territory are, respectively, 9.3 and 12.7 per 1,000 live births, rising to 14.8 per 1,000 live births for children under 5, while in Israel they are 1.7, 2.7 and 3.4 per 1,000 live births. In addition to direct attacks on the right to life, Palestinians also endure structural violence and racial discrimination, which impedes their full development.” /n/nThe structural violence of the occupation and the deliberate and excessive use of force against the Palestinians are indeed not limited to the recent events in Gaza. As the Special Rapporteur Ms Albanese stated in her 2023 report: “[t]he spectre of death looms as a dominant element in the lives of Palestinian children. This reality exerts a psycho-social toll on those who manage to survive, as poignantly expressed by Ouadia, a 14 year old girl, ‘fearing death does not prevent you from dying, but it prevents you from living.” /n/nOn Israels illegal occupation, Mr President, Members of the Court, the fundamental question posed by the United Nations General Assembly regarding the legality of the Israeli occupation is grounded in established international norms and legal principles. The State of Palestine, in its written statement, underscores the colonial and acquisitive nature of the occupation, emphasizing its deleterious impact on the Palestinian people. The occupation, characterized by persecution, racial discrimination and apartheid, stands in clear violation of three peremptory norms of international law: the right to self-determination, the prohibition of acquiring territory by force and the prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid. /n/nNumerous submissions have echoed these sentiments, highlighting the temporary nature of belligerent occupation as mandated by international law. The annexation of occupied territory and the settlement of the occupying Powers nationals in the occupied area are explicitly prohibited, constituting illegal acquisition of territory under the United Nations Charter and relevant United Nations resolutions. /n/nIsraels prolonged occupation, coupled with its policies of colonization and annexation, underscores its illegality under international law. These actions not only contravene the United Nations Charter but also violate general international law, including the peremptory norm prohibiting the acquisition of territory by force. /n/nFurthermore, arguments put forth by States and international organizations reject any justification for Israels occupation on grounds of self-defence. The occupation violates fundamental principles of international law, including the right to self-determination and the prohibition of acquiring territory by force. /n/nThe Advisory Opinion on Wall, which concluded that Israel cannot rely on self-defence to justify its actions, reinforces the notion that the occupation cannot be justified under international law. /n/nWhile the countries supporting Israel in these advisory proceedings have primarily focused on jurisdictional questions, a few States have addressed the merits of the occupation. One contends that an occupation can never be unlawful, regardless of violations of international humanitarian law. However, this argument stands in contravention of established legal principles and has been widely found to be incorrect. /n/nSwitzerlands distinction between the “law of occupation” and the “legality of an occupation” further elucidates the legal framework surrounding the issue. An occupation that involves annexation or de facto control of the occupied territory constitutes an illegal acquisition of territory by force, as prohibited under international law. /n/nUltimately, Israels occupation, characterized by its acquisitive, colonial and annexationist nature, represents a clear violation of international law. It serves as a means for the illegal acquisition of territory and must be brought to an immediate and unconditional end. /n/nI may also recall the United Nations Security Council resolution 2334 of 23 December 2016, which reaffirmed the obligations of Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention128 in regard to the protection of civilian persons in time of war. /n/nThat Security Council resolution also condemned all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, including, inter alia, the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant resolutions. Israel has flagrantly violated this and all other Security Council resolutions and it continues to do so in furtherance of permanently maintaining its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. /n/nTherefore, applying one or both of these frameworks, which Bangladesh endorsed for the reasons stated in our written submissions, we would respectfully submit that Israels occupation is undoubtedly illegal. I will now turn to the legal consequences. /n/nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the promise of a Palestinian State based on a diplomatic settlement grounded in law has been a prominent feature of the international agenda since 1948. Seventy-five years later, there exists a vast body of State practice and opinio juris that emphatically support the Palestinian peoples right to an independent State. The UN Security Council and the General Assembly have adopted numerous resolutions since 1948 on the “Question of Palestine”, recognizing, among other rights, the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the right of Palestinians to establish an independent State along the pre-1967 borders. Additionally, both the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Council have acknowledged the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination. Importantly, in 2004, this Court, in its Advisory Opinion on the Wall, explicitly affirmed the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination under international law. /n/nThe Courts steadfast commitment to universally uphold the rule of law, coupled with its principled stance on the legality of Israels half-century “temporary” occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, would shine a light of hope on the beleaguered Palestinian people. A decisive determination by the Court of the illegal status of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, and the legal consequences that arise from such status, including an immediate, unconditional and complete end to the occupation, would help secure the identity, respect, dignity and existence for the present and future generations of the Palestinian people, in a State of their own, at peace with Israel."

      "texto": "According to the Kingdom, the prohibition of the use of force is a rule of jus cogens83 that applies erga omnes. Indeed, in the Advisory Opinion on the Construction of a Wall, the Court confirmed that the principles as to the use of force incorporated in the United Nations Charter reflect customary international law. In 1966, the International Law Commission noted that the law of the United Nations Charter concerning the prohibition of the use of force in itself constitutes a conspicuous example of a rule of international law having the character of jus cogens84. Consequently, the International Law Commission included the prohibition of aggression in its list of rules of jus cogens85. /n/nAn occupation which fulfils the requirements of the right of self-defence may be considered as lawful under jus ad bellum. An occupation which does not fulfil, or no longer fulfils, these requirements may lose its legal basis and, hence, violate the jus cogens prohibition of the use of force. /n/nFinally, the Kingdom underscores that occupation is an inherently temporary use of force, because if it were to be permanent, it would qualify as annexation. As the Security Council emphasized in 1967, in its unanimously adopted resolution 242, the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible89. The Court recognized the customary status of the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force in the Advisory Opinion on the Construction of a Wall90. /n/nAccording to the Court, “a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and ‘elementary considerations of humanity” that they are “to be observed by all States whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law”91. In the Courts view, “these rules incorporate obligations which are essentially of an erga omnes character”92. The Kingdom considers these principles, furthermore, to be a peremptory norm of general international law, and would like to refer in this respect to the conclusion of the International Law Commission to include “the basic rules of international humanitarian law” in its list of rules of jus cogens93. /n/nAs noted before, no sovereignty can be established over occupied territory  and occupied territory may not be annexed. In this regard, an important provision under the law of occupation is that the occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies102. Under international criminal law, such transfers, directly or indirectly, by the occupying Power, constitute a war crime, as reflected in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court103. It is also prohibited to deport protected persons from the occupied territory104. /n/nCertain rules of international human rights law can moreover be characterized as peremptory norms of international law. According to the International Law Commission, this includes the prohibition of genocide113, the prohibition of torture114, the prohibition of slavery, and the prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid, as well as the right of self-determination115."

The occupying Power has to respect and protect the civilians in the occupied territory, who are regarded as protected persons100.

Therefore, the procedural legal consequence of a serious breach thereof is that all States, and international organizations, have legal standing to invoke responsibility for such a breach: they may claim cessation of continuing internationally wrongful acts, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, and performance of the obligation of reparation.

      "texto": "A serious, and more serious, violation that has been going on for decades is the extensive and systematic digging and tunnelling works around and underneath Al Aqsa Mosque, which threatens its structural integrity111. On 10 September 2023, a UNESCO decision criticized Israel for failure to cease these activities and described them as “persistent” and “illegal under international law”112. /n/nIn April 2022, during the holy month of Ramadan, the Israeli forces “raided the Al-Aqsa Mosque . . . during dawn prayers and attacked Palestinian worshippers with rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas, causing injuries to more than 150 people” and made more than 400 arrests113. In the same month, the ancient Qibli Mosque was subject to a similar attack and significant damage was caused to historic glass windows, the minbar and the carpet114. /n/nOn 13 December 2021 and on 31 March 2023, the Patriarchs and the Heads of Churches of Jerusalem issued a statement expressing their concern that Christians and their holy sites have become the target of frequent and sustained attacks by Jewish radical groups, “with the aim of diminishing Christian presence”115. /n/nMr. President, Members of the Court, Israeli violations in the Muslim and Christian holy sites violate the rules of international law, including Articles 27 and 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as we have stated in depth in our Written Statement116. /n/nFurthermore, Israeli violations of the historic status quo at the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem threaten their integrity. They inflame global religious tension and create confrontations along religious lines. /n/nMy second point concerns the right to self-determination. This right is well established in customary international law and is a norm of jus cogens120, from which there can be no derogation. It goes hand in hand with the obligation to respect the territorial integrity of the self-determination unit121, as well as the right to permanent sovereignty over natural resources122. /n/nRegrettably, Israels occupation has now lasted for well over half a century. During this period, Israel has intentionally breached fundamental principles of the law of occupation; the raison dêtre of these breaches is to deny the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. /n/nThe Occupied Palestinian Territory has been progressively fragmented. Its demographic composition has been and continues to be altered. Settlements and “outposts” expand rapidly, while the Palestinian peoples access to natural resources is denied and water resources are depleted124. /n/nAll this, Mr. President, Members of the Court, severely violates the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination, including their right to an independent State on the 4 June 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The only way, Mr. President, for the right to self-determination to be exercised is for the occupation to come to an end. /n/nTurning to my third point, Israels policies and practices also violate the law of occupation, which applies throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel has engaged in a policy of progressively establishing settlements and so-called “outposts”. Israels 2018 Basic Law declares: “[t]he State views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value, and shall act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation”125. As others have said, 2023 was a record year for settlement expansion. And just recently, in late January, senior Israeli officials called for resettlement of Gaza and for the expanding settlement in the West Bank126. /n/nIsraels settlements have created a patchwork of territorial units throughout the West Bank; they seek to create facts on the ground and they undermine the establishment of a sovereign, independent, contiguous and viable Palestinian State. As many others have said, they are often accompanied by brutal settler violence, tolerated or even supported by the Israeli authorities; one effect is to instil a sense of terror and fear in Palestinians, leading to displacement from their own land127. /n/nThis brings me to the fourth point: Israels policies and practices, when considered in their entirety, leave no doubt as to Israels intention to annex the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nThe facts speak for themselves: Israels 1980 Basic Law, which purported to annex Jerusalem de jure; the continued construction of the wall in the West Bank despite the Courts 2004 Opinion; the scale, infrastructure and location of Israeli settlements; the expansion of Israels direct civilian legal authority across the West Bank; and the continued displacement of Palestinians and the difficulties they face to return to their homes128. If there were any doubt, the map shown by the Prime Minister of Israel before the General Assembly last September129, which you have seen earlier this week, and his rejection of the two-State solution130 confirm Israels intention to annex. /n/nThe annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is a serious breach of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force — a peremptory norm of general international law. /n/nMr. President, my fifth point is that Israels discriminatory laws and practices severely affect the lives of Palestinians and demonstrate a total disregard for the occupying Powers duty to protect the rights and well-being of the Palestinian people131. /n/nSpecifically, the policy of discrimination constitutes a serious violation of treaty obligations and of customary international law, tantamount to apartheid. The CERD Committee, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have each urged Israel to amend the 2018 “Basic Law” so as to eliminate its discriminatory effects and to ensure equal treatment of all persons within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction132. This has not been done. /n/nDiscriminatory expropriation laws have been supplemented by a vast catalogue of military orders that have little or nothing to do with security or public order. Instead, they permit discriminatory treatment in practically every aspect of daily life — a discriminatory planning régime in which permits are routinely denied to Palestinians; the discriminatory practice of demolitions; and the use of zoning to designate military areas or so-called “nature reserves”, access to which is either denied to Palestinians or subject to Israeli permission133. /n/n All of this is backed up by increasingly frequent interventions by Israeli armed forces to suppress protests, often with lethal fire; by the apparent impunity of those who engage in violence against Palestinians; by the use of excessive force; by attacks on health services; and by the ever-increasing arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of Palestinians, including children134. /n/nFurther, as explained in our written pleadings135, Israel has engaged in acts that constitute crimes against humanity and has failed to prevent and punish such crimes."

      "texto": "Now, in the following oral submissions, Japan wishes to focus exclusively on the issues relating to the acquisition of territory by force in so far as they are relevant to the questions put to the Court by the General Assembly. Japan considers that the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force is an essential element of the rule of law among nations to which Japan is profoundly attached, and of particular importance to the peace and stability in the region and the international community. Japan believes that this prohibition provides an important safeguard for the international community against the return of rule by force. /n/nUnited Nations General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), which is commonly called “the Friendly Relations Declaration”, states that “[n]o territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”. The Court clarified in the Wall Advisory Opinion that the illegality of the acquisition of territory by force is a corollary of the prohibition of use of force incorporated in the Charter of the United Nations. In the same vein, on 18 April 2023, G7 Foreign Ministers, under the Japanese presidency, reaffirmed this prohibition. The relevant paragraph of the Communiqué stated: “The prohibition on the acquisition of territory resulting from the threat or use of force, reaffirmed in the Friendly Relations Declaration of 1970, should be observed in good faith.”79 /n/nMr President, let me begin with the first point that Japan wishes to make. The prohibition of territorial acquisition by force does not apply only to territory of States within settled or internationally recognized borders. Even in the cases of territory where internationally recognized borders do not exist, that prohibition extends to territory that is under the peaceful administration and could also apply to uses of force across international lines of demarcation. /n/nThe paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration relating to the principle of non- acquisition of territory by force states that “the territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State”. It is not surprising to find the focus on attempts by States to acquire territory of another State. As an example, in October 2022, the United Nations General Assembly condemned the attempted illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine80. In that situation, the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force clearly applies to those territories as they are within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. /n/nHowever, the Friendly Relations Declaration seems to go further than acknowledging the prohibition of the acquisition of the territories within the internationally recognized borders of States by force. In the same paragraph, it proclaims that “[n]o territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”, without reference to “the territory of a State”. /n/nJapan takes the position that where sovereignty over a territory is not internationally recognized, but where the territory is under peaceful administration by a State that has not itself occupied the territory by force, the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force applies also. This principle follows from the reasoning adopted in the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission81. As this Court has recognized in the Wall Advisory Opinion, the prohibition of territorial acquisition by force follows from the prohibition of force. Therefore, the scope of the prohibition should be determined with reference to the interpretation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter. The Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission found that Eritrea violated Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter by attacking and occupying in 1998 the town of Badme, which the Commission found was under “peaceful administration” by Ethiopia at the time. In this regard, the G7 Foreign Ministers Communiqué in April 2023 also stated: “We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the peacefully established status of territories by force or coercion anywhere in the world.” /n/nFurthermore, the Friendly Relations Declaration states that “[e]very State likewise has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate international lines of demarcation, such as armistice lines, established by or pursuant to an international agreement to which it is a party or which it is otherwise bound to respect”. This declaration indicates that the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force could also apply to a territory where internationally recognized borders do not exist but where parties are bound to respect certain international lines of demarcation. /n/nMr President, the acquisition of territory by force consists of two elements, namely (i) the establishment of control over the territory through forcible measures and (ii) the intention to appropriate that territory permanently82. By “acquisition” or indeed “annexation” of territory by force, we mean a situation where a State attempts to acquire territorial title on the basis of forcible acts and where the State does not otherwise have valid title to that territory. /n/nThe clearest case of annexation is an attempt to annex occupied territory de jure. In such a circumstance, the occupying State formally declares its sovereignty over the annexed territory. /n/nHowever, in the Wall Advisory Opinion, this Court indicated that annexation could also take place de facto where the actions of a State lead to what the Court called a “fait accompli”, that is, a situation on the ground which becomes permanent and which others are compelled to accept83. A State seeking to avoid the denunciation of the international community may be incentivized to refrain from formally declaring the annexation of territory. Without clearly expressing its intention to annex the territory, it may seek to gain permanent control over a territory it occupies by engaging in military operations and taking a series of measures that make it materially impossible for other claimants to restore the status quo ante without risking death, physical injury or damage to property. In other words, the occupying State may create what you called a “fait accompli” through these measures. /n/nThe effect of the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force would be seriously undermined if States were allowed to circumvent the prohibition by simply obfuscating their true intentions to annex a territory and coercing other claimants to accept its permanent control over the territory through measures that create a “fait accompli”. It is therefore important to clarify in what circumstances such measures would constitute de facto annexation and amount to an unlawful attempt to acquire territory by force. /n/nIn the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court considered that Israels construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as the creation of an administrative régime facilitating the establishment of settlements of Israeli citizens in areas lying between the Green Line and the wall are the types of actions which would be tantamount to de facto annexation if it created a “fait accompli” that had effectively become permanent84. /n/nJapan considers that certain acts which have continuous coercive effect in imposing control over territory may create a “fait accompli” and are likely to indicate intention to maintain permanent control over the territory. The following acts by occupying States may have such continuous coercive effects: /n/nFirst, large-scale alteration of the demographic composition of the territory, backed by military and other physical power, including through expropriation of land and eviction of the population. /n/nSecond, the construction and continued maintenance by an occupying Power of a network of physical infrastructure, particularly where these represent such significant financial investment that they may be deemed to be intended to subsist over a significant period of time. This may include, for example, roads, communication systems, healthcare facilities or large-scale military or law enforcement facilities. /n/nThird, the continuous forcible seizure and exploitation of the natural resources, including water, by an occupying Power. /n/nThese acts do not necessarily cause death, injury or destruction, but when they are implemented cumulatively at a significant scale and sustained for a long period, they would have continuous, even irreversible, effect on the territory. In such a case there may be evidence that the occupying States intention is to permanently establish sovereignty over the relevant area, even if it is doing so incrementally. If such acts are accompanied by statements of State officials affirming the irreversibility of measures or even asserting the intent to establish sovereignty over the occupied territories, the measures I have just mentioned above are even more likely to indicate intention to acquire territory and thus amount to a prohibited attempt to acquire territory by force. /n/nThe key question here is whether a State that does not otherwise have valid title to territory can acquire title through a use of force because the State claims to be acting in self-defence. Japan rejects this argument. Two alternative but interlinked arguments support this position. The first is that the principle prohibiting acquisition of territory by force precludes any acquisition of territorial title through force, regardless of whether that force is unlawful or permitted as an exercise of self-defence. Alternatively, and in any event, uses of force resulting in the annexation of territory will never be lawful as exercises of self-defence since permanent annexation can never be a proportionate response to an armed attack. /n/nI begin by outlining the first argument. Japan submits that the principle prohibiting forcible acquisition of territory is properly understood as providing that the use of force is never a valid basis for acquiring title, even if the initial use of force by the State could have been lawful85. /n/nThis blanket prohibition is a necessary consequence of the complete abolition of the right of territorial conquest in the context of the United Nations Charter. In the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court described the principle on the illegality of territorial acquisition resulting from the use of force as the “corollary” of the prohibition against the use of force itself86. It is also connected to other fundamental principles of international law, in particular the right to self-determination of peoples as set out in the Friendly Relations Declaration87 and recognized by this Court88. It accordingly reflects a fundamental shift in international law in the twentieth century, particularly after the entry into force of the United Nations Charter, which sought to minimize unilateral recourse to force in international relations. /n/nThe prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on acquiring territory by force form part of a coherent scheme with the right to self-defence. The right to self-defence provides for States to have recourse to force in order to defend their people and to preserve territory they already have. It does not allow a right to use force to gain additional territorial title89. /n/nI would also like to highlight that a finding by the Court that conquest could confer title upon a State where force was used in self-defence would, in practice, be liable to widespread abuse90. The proper scope of self-defence in international law is controversial. States frequently make contested claims that some use of force or another is lawful as an exercise of self-defence. States seeking to acquire territory by force could accordingly seek to exploit this ambiguity. This would threaten to undermine the principle and, alongside it, the prohibition on the use of force. /n/nJapans view on the proper scope of the principle is supported by the General Assemblys Friendly Relations Declaration, which states and I quote, again, because youve heard it many times: “The territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force . . . No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.”91 /n/nThis part of the declaration contains no exception for force used in self-defence and does not limit the principle prohibiting territorial acquisition by force to unlawful uses of force. By contrast, in the sentence immediately prior to the one that I have just quoted, the declaration prohibits “military occupation resulting from the use of force in contravention of the provisions of the Charter”92, indicating that where the use of force is not prohibited by the Charter, military occupation may be lawful93. /n/nThis conclusion  conclusion that the declaration endorses a blanket prohibition on acquisition of territory by force  is not affected by the declarations subsequent reaffirmation that it “shall [not] be construed as affecting” provisions of the Charter. The right of self-defence regulates the permissibility of uses of force in response to an armed attack, rather than dealing with the question of whether States can, through such use of force, acquire title to territory. The Friendly Relations Declaration accordingly clarifies that the answer to the latter question is “no” without purporting to affect the scope of self-defence as a justification for the use of force. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, let me turn to the alternative point with regard to the relationship between the prohibition of territorial acquisition by force and the right of self-defence  and this is my final point: annexation of territory can never meet the narrowly drawn requirements of the right of self-defence. /n/nAs the Court has repeatedly pointed out, any purported exercise of the right to self-defence must be necessary and proportionate94. Self-defence, by definition, can only justify the taking of temporary measures in order to achieve its aims. The aim of self-defence is limited to defending the attacked State and its people. Thus, even when a State has suffered an armed attack, it can never be proportionate to permanently deprive a people of its territory95. /n/nIn this regard, it is worth recalling that the acquisition of territory by force has been rejected in the context of States claiming to act in self-defence. The Security Councils response to Iraqs invasion and purported annexation of Kuwait in 1991 is worth noting. While demanding that Iraq “rescind immediately its actions”, the Security Council, in its resolution 686, simultaneously affirmed “the commitment of all Member States to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and Kuwait”96. It is thus clear that the territory of Iraq had not become liable to annexation even if States were to act in defence of Kuwait97. Another relevant example is, of course, Security Council resolution 242, which emphasized “the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” without drawing any distinction between lawful and unlawful uses of force98."

      "texto": "Mr President, Israel has been in occupation of the Palestinian Territory since 1967. Accordingly, in that territory, it is obliged to respect applicable international humanitarian law, including the law of military occupation, and international human rights law. /n/nThe defining feature of Israels occupation of Palestinian territory in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, has been continuous settlement activity. In our Written Statement, we have drawn on the authoritative reports of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to set out the numerous different ways in which this has occurred. But in summary, we say the following: /n/nIsrael has used different means to take and exercise control for non-military purposes over as much land in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as possible. /n/nOnce in control, Israel has undertaken permanent construction on this land, in particular developing or encouraging the development of permanent settlements, onto which it has incentivized large numbers of its own citizens to transfer. /n/nThrough its actions, Israel has fundamentally altered the demographics of the West Bank. As of 2022, almost 700,000 Israeli citizens were living in settlements in the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem. /n/nIsrael has extended the application of domestic Israeli law to those living in settlements, blurring the distinction between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory /n/nIsrael has transferred the exercise of authority in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in certain areas from military command to civilian control, integrating administration of the territory into that of Israel. /n/nBy transferring parts of its own civilian population into the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel has violated Article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It has continued to do this notwithstanding the Courts confirmation of its unlawfulness in the Wall case and despite being exhorted by both the Security Council and the General Assembly to cease this practice. /n/nIsrael has also continued to unlawfully destroy and appropriate property throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory as part of its policy of encouraging and facilitating the expansion of settlements. This destruction and appropriation of property cannot reasonably be justified by military necessity. Rather, it is clear that it has been done to facilitate and indeed encourage the expansion of settlements. Such destruction and appropriation of property clearly breaches the Fourth Geneva Convention and the laws and customs of war codified by the 1907 Hague Regulations. /n/nThere has also been a recent, marked increase in reports of Palestinian civilians being subjected to sustained, serious violence by Israeli settlers, with little or no protection from the Israeli security forces, contrary to international humanitarian law. The security forces have been reported, and recorded, not only watching this violence without intervening, but in some instances, even participating in it themselves. This has escalated since 7 October and the Secretary-General has warned that tensions have now reached “boiling point”. /n/nThe Secretary-General and High Commissioner have expressed concern that this violence, particularly when considered in light of the appropriation and destruction of Palestinian property, has compelled Palestinians to leave their homes, their farms and their grazing grounds. The Secretary-General has noted that the coercive environment created by Israel could amount to forcible transfer, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention which may amount to a war crime. /n/nThe evident permanence of the settlements can only be explained, in Irelands assessment, by Israels intention of annexing the land upon which they are built. In our view, the development and expansion of settlements clearly demonstrate that Israel is and has been engaged in a process of annexation of that land for decades. The absence of any declaration of annexation or formal de jure act of incorporation over most of the West Bank is immaterial. Despite references in the current Israeli Governments coalition agreements, which the Secretary-General describes as promoting a policy of “application of sovereignty” over the West Bank, previous history suggests that no announcement or formal act of incorporation may occur in the near future. /n/nNevertheless, in Irelands view, Israel is already engaged in the process of annexing Palestinian territory. It is doing so de facto, through its policy of encouraging demographic change in that territory by population transfer and by the continuous development and maintenance of permanent settlements and infrastructure. Ireland is concerned that it may also be doing so de jure, by increasingly extending the application of domestic Israeli law and civilian administration to the settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, thereby integrating them into its own territory and erasing the differences in law between Israel and the settlements. /n/nBut whether de facto, de jure or both, this process of annexation is in clear breach of the prohibition in international law against the acquisition of territory by threat or use of force, a fundamental principle of international law. To assert that this is not the case simply because Israel has not formally declared annexation would render the prohibition devoid of all meaning. That would permit States to acquire territory by force, without legal consequence, simply by declining to adopt a formal act of annexation or incorporation. /n/nInternational humanitarian law does not classify a military occupation as either lawful or unlawful per se rather it recognizes that military occupation may occur during the course of an armed conflict and it sets down rules to regulate the conduct of the occupying Power, in particular its armed forces. Military occupation is necessarily temporary in so far as international law prohibits the acquisition of territory by force. Occupation does not confer sovereignty rather, it is a temporary exception to sovereignty and, accordingly, it cannot be of indefinite duration. /n/nProlonged occupation over an extended period of time therefore unavoidably raises legal questions, in particular whether it constitutes a disguised form of annexation and/or a determined effort to deny the people of an occupied territory the exercise of their right to self-determination. In either case, the legality of the occupying Powers presence in the territory inevitably arises. While it is of course possible that a military occupation effected by force may be undertaken in exercise of the right in international law to the use of force in self-defence, any such occupation may involve no more and may endure no longer than is necessary and proportionate to the armed attack to which it is a response. /n/nIn the case of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israels military occupation commenced in 1967 and has continued now, uninterrupted, for some 57 years. It has also entailed, as I have said, extensive and continuous, permanent and deliberate settlement building. Neither the duration of the occupation nor the scale and extent of settlement activity is, in Irelands view, justified or permitted by the law regulating the use of force in self-defence. Indeed, if the security of one people can only be achieved by the occupation over so many decades of the territory of another people, one has to wonder whether there can be any military solution to the problem that it purports to address. In our view, the only effective solution to the problem can be a political one. /n/nMr President, I wish to turn now to the question of self-determination. As submitted in our Written Statement, Ireland has concluded that by its prolonged occupation of Palestinian lands and continuous settlement activity on those lands, Israel has prevented the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination. The principle of self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the two 1966 International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The content of that principle was elaborated in the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations, adopted by consensus at the General Assembly. That declaration makes clear that “Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and separate action, realization of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples bearing in mind that subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a violation of the principle, as well as a denial of fundamental human rights, and is contrary to the Charter”. /n/nIn the Wall case, the Court found that the construction of the wall and its associated régime severely impeded the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination. It therefore breached Israels obligation to respect that right. In Irelands view, the combination of Israels prolonged occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and its escalating settlement activity has done so on a far greater scale. That escalating activity has increasingly fragmented Palestinian presence upon and restricted Palestinian use of the land and the natural resources of the Palestinian people. It threatens the viability of a future Palestinian State. The nature, scale and duration of settlement activity is such that its purpose can only be to permanently obstruct the exercise of the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination. /n/nIreland has, with regret, concluded that by its prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory and the settlement activities it has conducted there for more than half a century, Israel has committed serious breaches of a number of peremptory norms of general international law and the corresponding erga omnes obligations to which they give rise, namely: /n/nthe basic rules of international humanitarian law; the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; and the prohibition of acquisition of territory by force."

It is widely recognized that these fundamental principles have the charactery of peremptory norms of general international law, or jus cogens, from which derogation is never permitted or, as the Court described them in its Advisory Opinion on the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, “intransgressible principles of international customary law”. In turn, peremptory norms of general international law give right to obligations owed to the international community as a whole (obligations erga omnes), in relation to which all States have a legal interest, a conclusion also recently reached by the International Law Commission. /n/nFor all States, as members of the international community as a whole to which the relevant obligations erga omnes are owed, the legal consequences of these serious breaches are, in Irelands view, straightforward. All States are obliged to co-operate to bring these breaches to an end through lawful means, not to recognize as lawful the situation created by them and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation. /n/nIn particular, States are obliged to co-operate to bring to an end Israels serious breach of its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination or, as the Court found in the Wall case, to see to it that any impediment to the exercise of that right is brought to an end. This includes co-operation by States through the United Nations and, as appropriate, other international organizations, including the European Union. /n/nAs regards the obligation not to recognize as lawful the situation created by these serious breaches, the Court has provided an example of how this may be achieved in its Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia. There, the Court found that the duty of non-recognition obliged States, inter alia, “to abstain from entering into economic and other forms of relationship or dealings with South Africa which may entrench its authority over the territory of Namibia”. /n/nIn the present case, we say that States are obliged not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israels breach of its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The General Assembly and Security Council have, in the past, called upon all States to refrain from rendering any assistance to the maintenance of situations of denial of self-determination. /n/nIn Irelands view, these obligations require all States, as well as international organizations with external trade competence (in the case of Ireland, the European Union), to review their trading relationships with the settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It requires them to take steps to prevent trade that assists in the maintenance of the situation created by the settlement activity, or that implicitly recognizes or serves to entrench or legitimize Israels settlement or annexation of that territory."

Therefore, we call for and emphasize the necessity of compliance with the rules of international law and the decisions issued by your esteemed Court. We specifically refer to the Advisory Opinion issued by your esteemed Court regarding the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian territories in the year 2004. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the Israeli occupying entity commits many violations and breaches of the principles of international law, and the international community has documented these violations, including those substantiated in reports by the Secretary-General of the United Nations submitted to the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council. These reports focus on investigating Israeli practices that impact the human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab inhabitants in the occupied territories, examining the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. /n/nThe Israeli occupying entity adopts multiple practices that rise to the level of genocide, referring specifically to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948, in particular, under Article II of the convention, which defines acts classified as genocide, the killing practices that have targeted civilians in residential areas, hospitals, schools and refugee shelters in Palestine in general, and in the Gaza Strip in particular, fall under the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that Article. Additionally, the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949, under Articles 146, 147 and 148, stipulates the imposition of criminal sanctions on parties to the convention in case of non-compliance with its provisions. /n/nThe oppressive practices affecting the city of Al-Quds, the capital of the Palestinian State, as well as the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, as the occupying entity attempts to impose a demographic reality aimed at a subsequent stage, which involves emptying the city of its original inhabitants and settling extremists and racists in it. This constitutes a violation of numerous resolutions, the latest being the United Nations General Assembly decision adopted on 21 December 2017. This decision came after a series of resolutions emphasizing the necessity of not to prejudice the demographic character of the Holy City of Al-Quds. /n/nImposing a suffocating economic blockade on all industrial, agricultural and commercial activities is evident in campaigns of land confiscation and seizure of homes and private property, supported by an official policy aimed at displacing the indigenous Palestinian population from their lands and demolishing their homes. These practices fall within the scope of crimes that amount to the destruction of an entire people. These actions have been documented by multiple reports, including those of the Secretary-General, the Human Rights Council and international organizations, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). /n/nThe continuous aggression on the Gaza Strip and the imposition of a land, sea and air blockade, along with a series of decisions, policies and procedures that target civilians, with the aim of changing the demographic reality on the ground, represent a flagrant violation of international law and human rights principles. The occupying entity has undertaken systematic measures, including mass arrests, demolition of homes, killing civilians, children, women, and the elderly. The right of the Palestinian people to their land has been subjected to a policy of deprivation and subjugation by force."

      "texto": "first, according to the United Nations Secretary-General, as a result of Israeli military operations, the entire population is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history and 2.2 million Palestinians there are struggling to simply make it through another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food and drinking water; second, according to the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, “for children in particular, there is no food, no water, no school; nothing but the terrifying sounds of war, day in and day out, and its people are witnessing daily threats to their very existence — while the world watches on”; and third, according to the WHO, the population in Gaza is facing extreme hunger, with insufficient food and high levels of malnutrition. Yet, the conditions in Gaza are becoming much worse every day. /n/nMr President, now I turn to the first section of our reasoning regarding the merits of the matter; here, we first argue that the Israeli occupying régime has violated, and continues to violate, on several grounds, the Palestinians right to self-determination. /n/nThe legal status of the right to self-determination is generally understood to be attributed to “peoples” and grounded first in the United Nations Charter, in several United Nations General Assembly resolutions and its inclusion in common Article 1 of the two International Covenants of Human Rights. As such, “all peoples have the right freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and their place in the international community and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development, and every State has the duty to respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter”. /n/nFirst and foremost, the prolonged occupation by the Israeli occupying régime confirms its intention to make it permanent, in violation of the principle of prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force. /n/nThe occupation of the Palestinian territories is the longest military occupation existing today. The right to self-determination of the Palestinian people continues to be violated as long as this occupation ages; this ongoing violation thwarts the Palestinians ability to rely on State-based rights and obligations under international law, depriving them of their inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to live in freedom, justice and dignity. /n/nThus, we request the Court to consider the very fact of prolongation of the occupation as an indicator of the violation of the right of Palestinians to self-determination. /n/nMr President, apart from prolonged occupation, altering the demographic composition in the occupied territories has led to violation of the Palestinians right to self-determination. The United Nations Security Council has a bulk of resolutions concerning the occupation of Palestinian territories, all condemning, among others, altering the demographic composition of these territories by the Israeli occupying Power. Hence, it is a well-established fact that the Israeli occupying régime has grossly violated international law on an ongoing basis. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention reads: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” Apart from that, the Court, in its opinion in the Wall case declared that: “[the] provision prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory”. /n/nFurthermore, the Court affirmed, in the same case, the violation of the right to self-determination based on measures taken by the occupying Power which has led to a change in the demographic composition of Palestine. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, forcible deportation of civilian populations, widely known for one of its most infamous instances as “Nakba Day”, has a long history. Essentially, with the illegal formation of the Israeli occupying régime in 1948 instead of the former British Mandate of Palestine, the demographic composition changed significantly with the displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinians. In fact, the Israeli occupying régime was illegally established that year through a violent, arbitrary process and involved the deportation or forcible transfer of hundreds of thousands of native Palestinians from their land to create a majority Jewish colony, in line with the demands of the Zionist movement. /n/nBy denying the right to return of forcibly deported Palestinians to Palestine, the Israeli régime continues to deprive those Palestinians of their right to live in their homeland. The majority of Palestinians live outside Palestine mainly in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, with many of them remaining stateless, living in crowded refugee camps that lack basic infrastructure. /n/nNeedless to say, forcible displacement of civilian population is of such a high significance that it has been defined as a war crime under Article 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. /n/nMr President, the next measure that has violated the right of self-determination of Palestinians, is altering the character and status of the Holy City of Al-Quds. The actions taken by the Israeli occupying régime with regard to the Holy City of Al-Quds have utterly disregarded the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. /n/nAltering the character and status of Al-Quds has had significant religious and cultural implications for the Palestinian people. Al-Quds Al-Sharif has a remarkable religious and historical significance for Palestinians, as well as for Muslims, Christians and Jews worldwide. By altering the status quo of the City and its holy sites, the Israeli occupying régime has undermined the cultural heritage and identity of the Palestinian people and has further violated their right to self-determination. /n/nThe construction and expansion of the settlements, along with the violation of Palestinians right to free movement and the revocation of residency permits, have altered the demographic and cultural character of the City as well. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the next series of measures depriving the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination comprise of discriminatory measures targeting the basic rights of the people in the occupied territories. This has been underlined by the United Nations General Assembly and recorded extensively to include the killing and injury of civilians, the forced displacement of civilians and a systematic policy of obstruction of humanitarian assistance. /n/nThe Israeli occupying régimes action, as manifested in various laws and policies, has created a system of discrimination that has negatively affected the Palestinian population. In Palestine, the occupying régimes expansionism has consolidated into apartheid through the longest occupation in modern history. It is well established that apartheid is a crime against conscience and dignity of mankind, and is further in violation of fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the United Nations Charter and crystalized in international human rights law, and seriously threatens international peace and security. /n/nThe Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Palestine has concluded that the political system of entrenched rule in occupied Palestine, which endows one racial-national-ethnic group with substantial rights, benefits and privileges while intentionally subjecting another group to live behind walls and checkpoints under a permanent military rule, satisfies the prevailing evidentiary standard for the existence of apartheid. Many laws, policies and practices implemented since 1948 by the Israeli occupying régime have been aimed at fragmenting the Palestinian people and dividing them into various groups; this clearly denies the Palestinian people its right to self-determination. /n/nIn tandem with the above, construction and expansion of the settlements, segregated roads, barriers and checkpoints has created a system of apartheid, effectively isolating Palestinian communities, which manifestly violates multiple provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. /n/nThe Court is, therefore, requested to opine that such policies and practices must be ceased immediately as they continue to violate the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the right to exercise permanent sovereignty over natural resources is an inevitable component of the right to self-determination. The two international covenants of human rights and a number of United Nations General Assembly resolutions recognize this right. The United Nations General Assembly has expressed grave concern over a range of practices by the Israeli occupying régime negatively impacting Palestinians natural resources. /n/nIt has been affirmed that the right of the Palestinian people to permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources is an integral component of the right to self-determination. It has been further confirmed that the right should be used in the interest of their national development, the well-being of the Palestinian people and as part of their right to self-determination. /n/nYet, Palestinians do not enjoy their own natural resources, which include land, fresh water and mineral resources. Imposing restrictions, by the Israeli régime, on access of Palestinians to water resources, groundwater and hydrocarbon deposits are all instances of flagrant violation of the right to self-determination."

In this context, an “interested” or “third” State, in accordance with the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, could be defined as one which is not directly affected or injured by an internationally wrongful act, and which has yet a legal interest in the protection and compliance of the rights by the very reason “of the importance of the rights involved . . . and their very nature” which makes them “the concern of all States”. /n/nAs regards the primary obligations of third States towards prolonged occupation of Palestine, the three obligations mentioned above remain relevant in accordance with paragraph 146 of the 2004 Advisory Opinion in the Wall case. /n/nIn addition to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, the primary triple obligations of third States towards serious breaches of erga omnes obligations find support in the practice of other United Nations organs as well. In its resolution 2334, the United Nations Security Council unequivocally reiterated the importance of States abstaining from recognizing the occupying Powers internationally wrongful acts. /n/nThe International Law Commission, in Draft Article 41 (1) of its 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, along with underlining the duty of a State to not recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach of erga omnes rules, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation, emphasized the duty of all States to co-operate through lawful means, in a joint and co-ordinated effort, to counteract the effects of these breaches. /n/nFirst, not to aid or assist, directly or indirectly, the Israeli occupying régime enabling it to continue its prolonged occupation of Palestine and/or any of its continued policies and practices that violate the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; this may include in particular avoiding any kind of political, military, economic or other co-operation with the Israeli régime enabling it to continue such violations. Second, not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from prolonged occupation, by the Israeli occupying régime, of Palestinian territory and/or any of its continued measures that violate the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people; and Third, to co-operate effectively with one another in all relevant fields and forums to bring to an end any impediment resulting from the ongoing violation by the Israeli occupying régime of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including from its prolonged occupation, and any of its measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Al-Quds; obviously, such co-operation is of utmost urgency and importance given the ongoing situation in the Gaza Strip, where, according to one estimate, Israels military is killing Palestinians at an average rate of 250 people a day, which exceeds the daily death toll of any other major conflict of recent years. /n/nIn this context, I recall this honourable Courts important Order of 26 January 2024 on the request by South Africa for the indication of provisional measures. The Order concerns the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and, as such, all States, in particular those providing support to Israel, are legally under the duty to prevent genocide, particularly by ceasing to provide any aid to the genocider. They are under a duty to punish perpetrators of the crime of genocide. Given the current extremely tragic conditions in the Gaza Strip, the Court is respectfully requested to, once again, call on the occupying régime to fully comply with the Order. Evidently, in practical terms, even the partial compliance of the Israeli régime with only subparagraph 1 of paragraph 86 of that Order is possible only through complete termination of all its military operations in the Gaza Strip."

I submit that the inaction or insufficient action of the Security Council, if not the main, is one of the main causes of the prolonged occupation of the Palestinian territories. All the atrocities and crimes committed by the Israeli régime in the past almost 80 years are a consequence of such inaction. Even today, the Security Council is paralysed due to the stalemate caused by a certain permanent Member. Other relevant United Nations bodies have also the responsibility to monitor and document human rights violations, and to facilitate bringing the perpetrators to justice. /n/nThis fact alone underscores how essential it is for the Court to remind the Security Council of its Charter-based obligation. It must also be made clear that such an obligation cannot be fulfilled by convening meetings or issuing certain impotent procedural resolutions; rather, it needs conclusive decisions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and a follow-up mechanism to ensure its full and prompt implementation by the Israeli régime."

The question of Palestine, with its origin in the mandate system under the League of Nations, goes beyond the scope of bilateral affairs between Palestine and Israel.

      "texto": "The Palestinian-Israeli conflict stems from Israels prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory and Israels long-standing oppression of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people fight against Israeli oppression and their struggle for completing the establishment of an independent State on the occupied territories are, essentially, just actions for restoring their legitimate rights. The right to self-determination serves as the precise legal foundation for their struggle. /n/nThe Palestinian people, being a group residing in territory under foreign domination2, is a sui generis international legal person as a whole3. The right to self-determination of the Palestinian people has been consistently reaffirmed in multiple United Nations resolutions4 and the Wall Advisory Opinion5. This is also widely recognized by most States and international organizations. /n/nEvery State is obliged to promote the realization of the right to self-determination and to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples of that right. In their pursuit of the right to self-determination, these peoples have the right to engage in struggles, seek and receive support11. On the basis of that right, the Palestinian people declared the establishment of the State of Palestine in 1988, which has been recognized by over 130 countries./n/nAgainst the backdrop of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, well-documented and widely recognized facts indicate that Israels oppressing policies and practices, throughout its prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory, have severely undermined and impeded the exercise and full realization of the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination. /n/nThe principle of non-use of force is at the core of jus ad bellum. As a corollary of this principle, the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force is firmly established in customary international law. Using force to occupy and maintain such occupation for the purposes of territorial acquisition or annexing an occupied territory by force in whole or in part, is each illegal. These are confirmed by the Friendly Relations Declaration of 1970, the “Definition of Aggression” of 1974 and the Wall Advisory Opinion15. /n/nIsraels occupation has been explicitly recognized as unlawful by several United Nations resolutions. Following Israels occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967, the Security Council adopted resolution 242 that “[e]mphasiz[es] the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war”. Similarly, multiple General Assembly resolutions affirmed the illegality of Israels occupation16. /n/nObviously, the rules of belligerent occupation are applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory and should be followed by both parties to the conflict. Facts indicate that relevant Israeli policies and practices have violated international humanitarian law and international human rights law. /n/nChina is of the view that the temporary and non-sovereign nature of belligerent occupation means that an occupying Power cannot acquire sovereignty over the territory during the belligerency. Belligerent occupation, under any circumstances, does not have the effect of lawful annexation. The rules of acquisitive prescription in international law does not apply to belligerent occupation. Fifty- seven years have passed since Israel began its occupation of the Palestinian territory. Regardless of the duration of the occupation, the unlawful nature of the occupation and the sovereignty over the occupied territories remain unchanged."

First, the General Assembly is competent to request an advisory opinion, given that the United Nations has “a permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy”. Second, the questions addressed to the Court are legal questions, “framed in terms of law and rais[ing] problems of international law”. The request that the Court determine the existence of violations of international law and their corresponding legal consequences is “by [its] very nature susceptible of a reply based on law”. /n/nMalaysia further submits that there are no compelling reasons preventing the Court from exercising its jurisdiction, which after all represents, in the Courts own words “its participation in the activities of the United Nations”, which, “in principle, should not be refused”. /n/nMalaysia stresses, first and in principle, that questions of self-determination are never purely bilateral matters between States: they refer to a peremptory norm of international law, which produces erga omnes obligations, owed to the international community as a whole. That being so, all States and the United Nations have a legal interest in the protection of the rights involved. But quite apart from that, the questions before the Court are not at all concerned with settling disputes between Israel and Palestine. The Court is requested to set out the legal consequences of Israels “policies and practices” in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Its advisory opinion will inform the exercise by the General Assembly of the “permanent responsibility” of the United Nations towards the question of Palestine. Such matters neither involve the determination of “permanent status” issues, nor are they for the parties to any “direct dialogue” to waive or disregard. /n/nAs a final point, Malaysia recalls that it was on these grounds that the Court decided to exercise its advisory jurisdiction in the Wall, rejecting these and other arguments which have been replayed in these proceedings, such as that the Court does not have sufficient information and evidence. Malaysia submits that the Court was correct then and that there are no more compelling reasons today for the Court to refuse to render the opinion requested than there were 20 years ago."

      "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "Malaysias submission today is straightforward. The “policies and practices” of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are a set of acts and measures that individually breach a number of rules of public international law. These “policies and practices”, however, taken together, also amount to a serious breach of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, which is protected by peremptory norm of international law. The occupation of Palestine, for its part, is nothing but these “policies and practices” itself. The occupation itself is thus in serious breach of peremptory norm of international law and must be brought to an end immediately. /n/nMalaysia submits that the “policies and practices” of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory consist of a set of acts and of legislative, administrative and other measures. These include: the construction, maintenance and extension of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; the establishment, maintenance, expansion and protection of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory along with their associated discriminatory legal régime; the demolition of Palestinians homes and of forced transfer of the Palestinians in that territory; the control and the provision of food, water, electricity and other amenities to the Occupied Palestinian Territory; and other acts and measures, detailed both by United Nations organs and by the States having chosen to appear before you. /n/nAll these “policies and practices” constitute in and of themselves violations of individual rules of international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of occupation, international human rights law, the prohibition of the use of force and the associated prohibition of acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force, and others. All of this is detailed in Malaysias Written Statement, as well as in other written statements submitted to the Court in these proceedings. And we have heard, over the last few days, many States argue before the Court along these lines. /n/nMalaysia submits that, taken together, these “policies and practices”, apart from breaching individual rules of international law, also constitute a serious breach of the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination, a jus cogens obligation incumbent on all States, and owed to the international community as a whole. /n/nMalaysia further submits that these “policies and practices” in and of themselves constitute the occupation of the Palestinian territory. These “policies and practices”, Mr President, are nothing but the means by which Israel is exercising its control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the means by which it is enforcing its occupation. These “policies and practices”, resulting as they do in a serious breach of the jus cogens right to self-determination, cannot but affect the legal status of the occupation of the Palestinian territory by Israel, rendering it unlawful. /n/nSecond, there can also be no doubt that the right to self-determination applies to the Palestinian people. As this Court noted in the Wall Advisory Opinion, “[a]s regards the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination, . . . the existence of a ‘Palestinian people is no longer in issue”. /n/nThe fourth submission that Malaysia wishes to make is that the “policies and practices” of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate numerous individual rules of international law, as well as each one of the four core, substantive elements of the right to self-determination. I will demonstrate this as briefly as possible, Mr President. /n/nIsraels “policies and practices” with respect to the legal status of East Jerusalem, along with its establishment, facilitation and expansion of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, with their associated infrastructure and discriminatory legal régime, amount to attempts at de jure and de facto annexation, respectively. This is in clear breach of the prohibition of acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force, a corollary of the prohibition of the use of force in the United Nations Charter, which is a peremptory norm of international law. Israels transfer of civilians into the Occupied Palestinian Territory is a breach of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and constitutes a war crime per the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Apart from constituting individual breaches of international law, these “policies and practices” violate the territorial integrity of the Palestinian people, and thus the right to self-determination. /n/nIsraels “policies and practices” which aim at changing the demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, along with the creation of enclaves of Palestinians, the demolition of their homes, the limitation of their freedom of movement, including the blockade, siege and purported evacuation of the Gaza Strip, constitute violations of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law. But they also violate the unity and integrity of the Palestinian people, and thus its right to self-determination. /n/nIsraels “policies and practices” of expropriation of Palestinian land for use as settlements, of control over all water resources in the West Bank and control of water provision in the Gaza Strip, of granting licences for oil and gas extraction, and of operating quarries in the Occupied Palestinian Territory constitute violations of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law. But they also violate the permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people over its natural wealth and resources. They thus violate its right to self-determination. /n/nIsraels “policies and practices” of exploitation of natural resources, of restrictive zoning and planning régimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, of blockading Gaza and subsequently razing it to the ground, of hampering and limiting access of Palestinians to health services, educational establishments and primary sources of water, of preventing Palestinians from accessing sites of religious and cultural importance in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, of restricting their freedom of association and expression, and of condoning settler violence constitute violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. But they also violate the Palestinian peoples freedom to pursue their economic, social and cultural development, and thus its right to self-determination. /n/n“[A]long with measures taken previously”, the Court said. That was a reference, as is evident from the preceding paragraphs of the Advisory Opinion, to the “policies and practices” of Israel involving the establishment of settlements and their associated régime. If that was the case then, 20 years ago, a fortiori this must be the case now  how could it not be? If anything, Israel has maintained and extended the wall, and it has escalated the “measures taken previously”, ramping up the establishment of the settlements, expanding them, providing funding and amenities to them, as well as security, and extending the associated discriminatory legal régime. It has also continued and escalated the demolition of Palestinian homes, the practice of forced transfers and the transfers of its own civilians into the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nThe “a fortiori” argument I made with respect to the existence of a violation of the right to self-determination applies here as well: this is not just any violation, Mr President. It is a serious breach of a peremptory norm of international law. If it were so with respect to the much more limited issue before the Court in 2004, it must certainly be so today. We are no longer talking about the construction of a wall; we are talking about the whole host of “policies and practices” of the acts and measures so well documented by the United Nations and by most of the States that have spoken in these proceedings. These could not amount to anything less than what the construction of a wall amounted to 20 years ago. Indeed, they underscore the devastating deterioration of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since then. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, I will have to return to the legal consequences of Israels “policies and practices” in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in the final part of my presentation. But before I do so, I would like to conclude this part of the argument. I have established so far that Israels “policies and practices” in the OPT constitute not only violations of several rules of international law, but also violations of each core element of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. Malaysia submits that this serious breach of a most fundamental peremptory norm of international law renders unlawful the occupation as a whole. /n/nIn particular, Malaysia submits that it is the “policies and practices” discussed and assessed in these proceedings that constitute the occupation. These “policies and practices” are in fact the occupation itself. There are many means by which Israel enforces its control, the means by which it occupies the Palestinian territory. And they are also unlawful: they breach a great number of rules of international law and ultimately result in a serious breach of the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination. This must mean that the occupation as a whole is unlawful, as it constitutes a flagrant denial of the right to self-determination."

The Court called upon all States not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. The Court also found that “[i]t is . . . for all States . . . to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end”.

Further, all States must not recognize as lawful the situation created by the serious breach of the right to self-determination, that is, the occupation of the Palestinian territory. Finally, all States must not render aid or assistance to Israel in maintaining the unlawful denial of the Palestinians right to self-determination, thus the occupation of the Palestinian territory.

      "texto": "It is, as you know, settled that the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War applies to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as noted by the Court in the Wall Opinion. In addition to that, the 1907 Hague Regulations “have become part of customary law” and therefore apply to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Despite the Israeli argument that the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court found as a matter of treaty law, that it does indeed apply, as it would to “any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict arising between two or more High Contracting Parties”. /n/nIn 2001, the Conference of High Contracting Parties “reaffirm[ed]” the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Al Quds, and called, inter alia, upon “the Occupying Power to immediately refrain from committing grave breaches involving any of the acts mentioned in art. 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, such as wilful killing, torture, unlawful deportation, wilful depriving of the rights of fair and regular trial, extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity”. /n/nA variety of international human rights treaties apply to these proceedings. Among the most important of these are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Both States, Palestine and the occupying force, are parties to these treaties. /n/nThe prohibition against the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and is an essential cornerstone of the international legal order. /n/nArticle 2 (4) provides: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” /n/nThe prohibition of racial discrimination and apartheid is reflected most in CERD. As the Court has very recently underlined that 182 States are parties to CERD  a fact which confirms the universal character of the convention. Those parties include both the State of Palestine and the occupying force. /n/nIt is well established that the prohibition of racial discrimination forms part of customary law and has long been recognized as a peremptory norm. The Court in Barcelona Traction considered the prohibition of racial discrimination to be a norm of erga omnes character, stating that: /n/n“Such obligations derive, for example, in contemporary international law, from the outlawing of acts of aggression, and of genocide, as also from the principles and rules concerning the basic rights of the human person, including protection from slavery and racial discrimination.” /n/nThe right of self-determination exists in customary international law and is recognized by the United Nations Charter as well as in the ICCPR and ICESCR. /n/nIt must be also stated that the obligation to respect a peoples right of self-determination is a peremptory principle of general international law. As the Court noted in the East Timor case, the right to self-determination “is one of the essential principles of contemporary international law”, enjoying an erga omnes character. /n/nThe United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly confirmed the right of Palestinian people to self-determination, for example, resolution 2672 of 8 December 1970. It recognized “that the people of Palestine are entitled to equal rights and self-determination, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations” and that “full respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine is an indispensable element in the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, now we come to the illegality of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territory. The Israeli six-decade occupation of Palestinian territory is a continuing, gross and systematic breach of its legal obligations under the United Nations Charter and the general international law, also international humanitarian law, international human rights law and customary international law, including the violation of at least three peremptory norms of general international law of a jus cogens and erga omnes character. It shows that Israel has annexed and plans to continue to annex Jerusalem, Al-Quds, and the rest of the West Bank; that it has imposed systematic and comprehensive racial discrimination tantamount to apartheid against the Palestinian people based on their race; and that it has denied their right to self-determination in their own land. /n/nIn view of these policies and practices, Israels occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful, rendering Israels continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory an internationally wrongful act as it seriously breaches at least three peremptory norms of general international law, derogation from which is not permitted. /n/nOn the matter of self-determination, Israel has not only denied the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, but actively tried to suppress and to extinguish it, even after the Courts ruling in 2004 that Israel has an obligation erga omnes to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Israel has in fact escalated its policies and practices with the specific intention of permanently precluding the exercise of the right of Palestinian people including their right to independence in their State"

In turn, Article 96 of the United Nations Charter: “The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question”. In practice, it is primarily the General Assembly that has most frequently utilized this procedure to date. After all, when the General Assembly decides to request the Court to deliver an advisory opinion, this means that the request reflects an important concern of the international community, seeking a legal answer. The Court itself observed that the General Assembly, within the scope of its peacekeeping responsibilities, has a broader perspective than that of the Security Council, as it also considers humanitarian, social and economic aspects. /n/nAn attentive look at the Courts jurisprudence points to the fact that “only ‘compelling reasons may lead the Court to refuse its opinion in response to a request falling within its jurisdiction”. Although the Court has the discretionary power to refuse to respond to a request for an advisory opinion for reasons of judicial propriety, it has not availed itself of this option thus far. /n/nIn the present case, it is incontestable that the questions included in the relevant General Assembly resolution are clearly specific questions of legal character. Any attempt to qualify them as non-specific or non-legal should fail. It is worth noting that the Court in the Wall Advisory Opinion rejected similar attempts. In essence, in the Wall Advisory Opinion, the central issue revolved around the construction of the wall and its impact on the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. Twenty years later, the context has broadened substantially. The Court is now tasked with determining the legal status of the ongoing occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 1967, given its persistence for over 57 years."

      "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "Regrettably, the above-mentioned foundational rules have not been upheld in the case of Palestine. The conflict between Palestine and Israel, hereafter referred to as the “occupying Power,” is an illegal occupation conflict, involving on one side an occupying Power equipped with all military means, and on the other side an occupied nation without defensive capabilities, facing daily expulsion, human rights violations and all sufferings associated with any occupation situation. /n/nOver the past decades, the situation between the Palestinians and the occupying Power has been extremely tense, resulting in serious human rights law and humanitarian law violations committed by the latter. Various intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations have documented these violations by publishing comprehensive reports. This climate of violence compromises any possibility of reasonably discussing the issues at stake. This is further exacerbated by the recent developments in Gaza. The occupying Power has waged an illegitimate war on the Palestinians in Gaza characterized by numerous international law violations. The ongoing flagrant violations have been highlighted in a series of statements issued, amongst others, by the United Nations Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council. /n/nIn the 1948 Nakba, 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced, and since then millions more. The situation has deteriorated exponentially since the illegal occupation started in 1967. The occupying Power has engaged in a forced displacement campaign against the Palestinians by demolishing their homes and confiscating their lands. Forced displacement violates international law. The occupying Power is under the obligation to ensure that its operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory comply with the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War to which it is a party. Article 49 of this convention clearly prohibits “forcible transfers, individual or mass... regardless of their motive,” which includes forced displacements as well as expulsions from the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Furthermore, Article 53 of the same instrument prohibits the destruction of property. Finally, under Article 147, illegal transfers, destruction, and appropriation of property carried out on a large scale is prohibited. /n/nAs Kuwait explained in its Written Submission, the occupying Power has also committed other grave violations of international law, including the policy of settling parts of its population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This unlawful policy has and continues to be deplorably promoted by the successive governments of the occupying Power. Since 1967, the occupying Power has embarked on an intensive campaign of colonization. Some settlements consisted of just a few prefabricated houses, while others expanded to become fully fledged small towns. In early 2023, there were around 730,000 Israeli settlers and over 280 Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including 230,000 settlers in East Jerusalem. These settlements are sustained by a network of military checkpoints and restricted zones, as well as Jewish-only roads and highways, all of which limit gravely the lives and livelihoods of Palestinians and violate their fundamental human rights. Both the construction of settlements and the transfer of settlers to the West Bank and Gaza are grave violations of international law, in particular Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which states that “the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. /n/nIt is also noteworthy, Mr President, that settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are not governed by the same laws that apply to the indigenous inhabitants of the territory. Jewish settlers are provided with special rights, facilities and subsidies that are denied to the indigenous Palestinian population. The occupying Powers policy not only supports the existing settlers, but also incentivizes new settlers. The discriminatory policies and practices also violate the sovereignty of Palestinians over their natural resources — allowing the settlers and foreign companies to exploit the water and agricultural products of the occupied land without any benefit to the occupied population. It is widely recognized that the occupying Power has codified its discriminatory policies and practices against Palestinians in its legislation. Specifically, it grants rights to Israeli Jews and systematically discriminates against Palestinians. For instance, the Land Acquisition Law of 1953 facilitates the alienation of confiscated Palestinian land for the benefit of various institutions of the occupying Power. Quasi-public organizations, such as the Jewish Agency, engage in material discrimination, in particular through the allocation of confiscated Palestinian land to Israeli Jews. /n/nIn their written submissions, the great majority of States participating in these proceedings, along with three intergovernmental organizations, concluded that the occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal. Kuwait firmly agrees with this view. In its Written Submission, Kuwait identified several reasons proving the illegality of this occupation. I will provide a brief overview of these reasons for the Court. /n/nThe occupation violates a series of jus cogens norms. First, the obligation to respect the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. The right of people to self-determination is a right clearly recognized in international law as evidenced by several instruments, and as submitted by 35 States and international organizations participating in these proceedings. This is articulated in Article 1 (2) of the United Nations Charter which defines the purposes of the United Nations including “[t]o develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace”. The same obligations are expressed in Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. /n/nSecond, Kuwait joins the participants in these proceedings who have concluded in their Written Submissions that the ongoing military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal because it violates the jus cogens prohibition on the use of force. Third, the occupying Power, by confiscating and annexing parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, violates the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force. This was underscored by 38 participants in the written proceedings. This fundamental norm was incorporated into Security Council resolution 242 of 1967 and reaffirmed in Security Council resolution 338 of 1973. Accordingly, the occupying Power does not have the right to claim sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967. /n/nFourth, the occupation is illegal because it obviously violates the law of military occupation. For instance, the occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is not of a minimal duration. Facts clearly demonstrate that it is intended to be prolonged and ultimately permanent. A permanent occupation constitutes a serious violation of international law. Based on the verifiable evidence available to us, it is indisputable that this is precisely what is happening in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This prolonged occupation and indefinite violation of the Palestinians right to self-determination renders the occupation illegal. Moreover, the conduct of the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violates the rules of international humanitarian law. In the Wall Advisory Opinion, the Court stated that: “the Fourth Geneva Convention . . . is applicable in the [occupied] Palestinian territories.” The Court also determined that the Hague Regulations are reflective of customary international law and thus applicable to the conduct of the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Far from complying with the law of occupation, the actions of the occupying Power disregard international law. These actions include, inter alia, the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, confiscation of Palestinian public and private property, and its failure to protect Palestinians from violence caused by State actors and private parties, including, inter alia, armed illegal settlers. /n/nFinally, the occupation violates the jus cogens prohibition of apartheid. Twenty-one participants in these proceedings supported this in their Written Submissions, while fourteen maintained that the situation of apartheid qualifies the occupation as illegal under international law. The prohibition of apartheid is evidenced in various sources of international law. The occupying Power is bound by the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which it is a party. Furthermore, it shall abide by the prohibition of apartheid as enshrined in the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and the Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, which codifies customary international law. Several voices and independent experts have warned that the occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory amounts to a régime of apartheid. For instance, in March 2022, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 in his report reached a similar conclusion."

Its breaches of these rights and obligations engage the occupying Powers international responsibility. The occupying Power must therefore take several measures. First, it must provide Palestinians with relief in accordance with the principles of customary international law on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts.

      "texto": "Indeed, Israels genocidal war on the people of Gaza has shown that the situation in Palestine is the most pressing threat to international peace and security. As Secretary-General Guterres emphasized, recent events did not occur in a vacuum. Rather, they grew out of Israels illegal 57-year occupation of the Palestinian territories. Israel has denied the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination. It has ethnically cleansed and colonized Palestinians lands. Furthermore, it has implemented an apartheid régime, that is to say, a régime of systematic racial oppression and discrimination, established with the intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. To maintain that régime, it has killed, maimed and imprisoned tens of thousands of men, women and children. These are the root causes of the situation we face today. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court: Israels illegal and discriminatory policies and practices are the tools of a long-standing settler-colonial project. As Qatar explained in its Written Statement, these policies are designed to promote a single goal: the permanent colonization of the Occupied Palestinian Territory for the exclusive benefit of Israel and the Jewish Israeli settlers. This goal is essentially linked to Israels oppressive and discriminatory practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and is the root cause of the cycles of violence there. /n/nIn Chapter 2 of its Written Statement, Qatar described in detail the eight main categories of discriminatory policies and practices that Israel employs in furtherance of its settler-colonial project. In Chapter 3 of its Written Statement, Qatar explained that these policies and practices entail flagrant violations of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, and constitute a crime against humanity, war crimes, genocide and ethnic cleansing. /n/nIt is Qatars position that, in order to fully respond to question (a), the Court should assess the legality of each of Israels main policies and practices through these lenses. A fulsome response to question (a) is no less than a clear answer to question (b). The Court should not underestimate the impact that findings of fact and law will have in bringing Israels specific policies and practices to an end, to encouraging accountability and to provide victims with a sense of justice. /n/nThe first central feature of Israels settler-colonial project is, of course, settlement. /n/nThe establishment and development of Jewish Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory began immediately after Israel occupied it in 1967. Israel establishes Jewish Israeli settlements on seized Palestinian lands, finances and facilitates the construction of housing and infrastructure, and incentivizes Jews from around the world to settle there. /n/nBy 2023, over 700,000 settlers, or approximately 11 per cent of Jewish Israelis, were living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nThe settlement activity is relentless. In a January 2024 report, which you can find at tab 3 of your folders, the Israeli human rights group Peace Now explained how the war in Gaza has been exploited as cover for an unprecedented surge in settlement activities. /n/nThe same is happening in East Jerusalem. /n/nAnd even Gaza is now at risk. The Israeli Security Minister recently stated that “[n]ot only do I not rule out Jewish settlement [in Gaza], I believe it is also an important thing.” On 28 January 2024, a conference dedicated to the resettlement of Gaza was held in occupied Jerusalem, which was attended by 12 Israeli government ministers. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court: let me pause here to make a brief remark about the situation in Gaza as it relates to the advisory proceedings. The contentious proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention do not mean that the recent situation in Gaza should not be addressed here. Gaza is part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It was occupied before 7 October and it is occupied today. Israels policies and practices referred to in question (a) include its policies and practices in Gaza. The Court will examine the situation in Gaza through the lens of the Genocide Convention in the case brought by South Africa. Here, the Court can, and indeed must, apply all aspects of international law to the situation in Gaza, including well before 7 October. /n/nThis brings me to Israels second central policy and practice in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is displacement. In order to establish its settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel seizes public and private land, and forcibly displaces Palestinians. It does so through home demolitions, evictions, building restrictions and by establishing buffer or military zones. /n/nAgain, the situation has only grown worse since 7 October 2023. As is well established, Israel has forcibly displaced at least 75 per cent of the population of Gaza. /n/nThis policy is promoted by Israeli leaders as a solution to their Palestinian “demographic problem.” Israeli Minister of Culture stated that the Palestinians “can go to Ireland or [to the] deserts, the monsters in Gaza should find a solution by themselves.” /n/nWhile all eyes may be on Gaza, the situation in the West Bank is rapidly deteriorating. At least 13 different communities in the West Bank have faced forced displacement since 7 October. That has resulted in a north-south stretch of 20 km east of Ramallah being cleared of nearly all Palestinians. /n/nThe third Israeli practice is fragmentation. /n/nIn order to implement the demographic and physical control necessary to perpetuate the occupation and establish further settlements, Israel divides and isolates Palestinians. It relegates them to fragmented enclaves, restricts their movement and renders their daily lives all but unlivable. This is what Namibia and Belize aptly refer to as “strategic fragmentation.” /n/nIsrael has imposed a full blockade on Gaza since 2007, entirely cutting its population off from the rest of the world. On 7 October, Gaza had already been described by the United Nations Secretary General as “hell on earth.” Today it is indescribable. /n/nIn the West Bank, Israel has for decades implemented a system of draconian checkpoints, subjecting millions of Palestinians to daily indignities. Human Rights Watch has documented “more than 40 kilometers of West Bank roads that authorities prohibit Palestinians from traveling on.” /n/nSince 7 October, Israel has implemented an unprecedented lockdown on the entire civilian territory of the West Bank. It has closed much of its vast network of checkpoints, completely cutting off cities, towns and villages from each other. /n/nThe fourth practice that characterizes Israels occupation is its discriminatory and unlawful violence. /n/nIsraeli forces and Jewish Israeli settlers — often with the support of the State — use violence to crush even non-violent resistance to the occupation and to perpetuate a climate of fear and repression. /n/nIsraeli violence has been part of the fabric of life for Palestinians even before the beginning of the occupation in 1967. And Gaza has always paid the highest price. In the 15 years before 7 October, Israeli military campaigns killed 5,365 Palestinians in Gaza, the majority of whom were undisputedly civilians. Of course, this shocking statistic pales in comparison to what we have seen in the past four months. /n/nAt the same time, the Court cannot ignore the ever-worsening situation in the West Bank. /n/nSince 7 October, 397 Palestinians have been killed across the West Bank, and 453 have been injured. Even before 7 October, 234 Palestinians had been killed in 2023, which was the highest number on record. /n/nCivilian casualties are not just collateral damage in Israeli attacks, they are the main target. The use of warplanes, armed drones, attack helicopters and missiles was once unprecedented in the West Bank. Now it is routine. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court: Israels victims are often children. They include five-year-old Ruqaya, who was shot in the back by Israeli forces on 7 January at a military checkpoint in the West Bank. Her body was withheld from her family by Israeli forces for 10 days. Just last week, Israeli forces also shot 16-year-old Neehel in the head, killing him as he was leaving school. Neehel was the one hundredth Palestinian child killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since 7 October. /n/nThis brings me to the fifth practice implemented by Israel, which is its discriminatory military legal system in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This system privileges Jewish Israeli settlers while depriving Palestinians of the most basic legal protections. A pillar of this system is the practice of indefinite administrative detention of Palestinians without charges. As we detailed in our Written Statement, this practice was widespread before 7 October. Its use has increased excessively since then, in what some rights groups have characterized as mass enforced disappearances. In the past four months alone, thousands of Palestinians have been placed in administrative detention. In Gaza, they are rounded up, blindfolded, disrobed, humiliated and detained en masse in makeshift outdoor prisons. You can find detailed reporting at tabs 5 and 6 of your folders."

      "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, the Written Statements and Comments that addressed question (b) overwhelmingly endorse a finding by the Court that Israels occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal. This was the express conclusion of at least 38 Participants in these proceedings, with at most two States reaching the opposite conclusion. /n/nThose Participants finding that the occupation is illegal offered a number of lines of analysis to support their shared conclusion. This is unsurprising. Israels occupation has violated so many fundamental principles of international law that it would be hard to point to just one reason for its illegality. /n/nIn Chapter 3 of Qatars Written Comments, we identified five main reasons as to why Israels occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal. With its Written Comments, Qatar also submitted a detailed appendix, compiling relevant statements by participating States and international organizations. These can be found at tabs 7 to 15 of your folders. We hope that Qatars analysis will be helpful for the Courts work. /n/nFirst, the occupation contravenes the jus cogens obligation to respect the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. Thirty-nine States and international organizations found that the occupation violates the right of self-determination. Twenty-eight of those Participants underscored that the occupation has become illegal for this reason. /n/nSecond, Israels occupation also violates the jus cogens prohibition of apartheid. Twenty-five Participants endorsed a finding of apartheid. Among those reaching this conclusion, 16 Participants underscored that the situation of apartheid renders the occupation itself illegal. /n/nThird, Israels occupation is illegal because it violates the jus cogens prohibition on the use of force. This was the conclusion of 18 Participants. /n/nFourth, by virtue of its illegal annexation of portions of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel has breached yet another jus cogens norm, the prohibition on the acquisition of territory through the use of force. At least 41 Participants in the proceedings have pointed this out, with 31 of them underscoring that the occupation is illegal as a whole because Israels annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is an integral feature of the occupation. /n/nFifth and finally, Israels occupation is illegal due to the fact that it is not of a temporary character, not being carried out in good faith or not being administered in the best interests of the occupied population. Seventeen States reached such conclusions. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, the State of Qatar endorses all of these arguments for the illegality of the occupation. While it is of course for the Court to decide how best to answer the General Assemblys question (b), it is Qatars respectful submission that the Court should not limit itself to choosing only one of these grounds for illegality. Unlike contentious cases, judicial economy does not support the adoption of only the narrowest reasoning possible in these proceedings. To the contrary, in the context of an advisory opinion, the Courts function is to provide legal advice to the organ requesting the opinion. There are multiple relevant legal régimes applicable to the situation, and the Courts advice on each of these frameworks will be of immense value to the General Assembly and to the international community at large. /n/nIn this connection, Qatar and many other States attach particular importance to a finding that Israels occupation, by its nature, amounts to a régime of apartheid. /n/nA finding of apartheid is not just the most accurate label for what the occupation has become. It also provides a tangible but flexible roadmap for what must come next. What ending apartheid requires is achieving a situation in which all people — Israelis and Palestinians — equally enjoy their fundamental human rights and dignity. With the requisite finding of apartheid by the Court, the international community, including the General Assembly, can activate similar mechanisms for bringing about an end of the occupation as it did with the apartheid régime in South Africa. This is the surest path to truth, justice, and yes, reconciliation."

      "pregunta":"The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, I come to my first point. The Palestinian people have, as the Court itself has recognized, the right to self-determination. This right, which is codified in the two United Nations Human Rights Conventions, is “one of the essential principles of contemporary international law”. All States have a legal interest in protecting that right, which has the status of jus cogens. Israeli measures that severely impede the exercise by the Palestinian people of the right to self-determination are in breach of Israels obligations to respect that right. Pakistan strongly believes in the inherent right of people to live freely and in the justice of struggle for freedom from alien subjugation under the right of self-determination. /n/nI turn to my second point: the question of Israels occupation and annexation. It has always been the position of the United Nations that it “cannot condone a change in the status juris resulting from military action contrary to the provisions of the Charter. The Organization must, therefore, maintain that the status juris existing prior to such military action be re-established by a withdrawal of troops, and by the relinquishment or nullification of rights asserted in territories covered by the military action”. /n/nThus, after the Six-Day War, the Security Council determined in resolution 242 (1967) that Israel must withdraw its armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict. In resolution 476 (1980), the Security Council reaffirmed “the overriding necessity for ending the prolonged occupation of Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967”. /n/nIsraels occupation is no longer, if it ever was, a military occupation; it is annexation. In East Jerusalem, the annexation is de jure; in the rest of the territory, it is de facto. But the formal characterization matters little. To use the words of the Court in the Wall case, the occupation is today, “notwithstanding the formal characterization . . . tantamount to de facto annexation”. This now applies to the entire territory. This may have been the intention all along. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion affirmed in 1950 that “the Israeli Empire must comprise all the territories between the Nile and the Euphrates”, and this was to be achieved as much by invasion as by diplomacy. More recently, Prime Minister Netanyahu has declared that his Government will be “applying Israeli sovereignty over all the communities formed through the transfer of Israeli settlers and not one residential community will be uprooted”./n/nThrough its settlement policy, Israel has sought to create “irreversible facts on the ground”. It has aimed to create physical facts which in practical terms make it as difficult as possible to bring an end to its prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Notwithstanding, the Security Council has reaffirmed that the settlements constitute “a flagrant violation under international law”. /n/nAs this Court said in the Namibia case: “A binding determination made by a competent organ of the United Nations to the effect that a situation is illegal cannot remain without consequence.” As in that case, in answering the legal questions now referred to it, the Court is not concerned with the question of what practical steps would be required to cease the occupation. /n/nI come to my third point, regarding systematic racial discrimination. Israels policies and practices amount to systematic racial discrimination and apartheid. Israel has imposed a system of racial discrimination against the Palestinian people since 1967. It is a system that distinguishes — deliberately and systematically — along ethnic and religious lines between the Palestinian population and Jewish Israeli settlers illegally transferred into the territory. The purpose of domination and oppression may be inferred from Israels pattern of conduct against the Palestinians. /n/nI turn to my fourth point: Jerusalem and its holy places. The Holy City of Jerusalem is unique in that it is sacred to all three Abrahamic religions. Under the historic status quo, it is the right of Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities freely to access and worship at their holy places in the city. Ottoman decrees set out these rights in the nineteenth century. The régime was later confirmed in multilateral and bilateral instruments. The historic status quo has today developed into a so-called “objective régime”, which captures the point that it is characterized by a permanence which the instruments that established it do not themselves necessarily enjoy. Every State interested therefore has the right to insist upon compliance with this régime. /n/nUnder Israels prolonged occupation, Christians have not been free to access or worship in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Muslims have not been free to access or worship at Haram al-Sharif and in the Al Aqsa Mosque, to name only some prominent sites. The rights under the historic status quo must immediately be restored. This issue is of great importance to Pakistan, which is home to the second largest Muslim population in the world. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, any conclusion could not be reconciled with the Courts Opinion on Namibia. There are certain clear parallels with the present case. The General Assembly had condemned South Africas occupation of Namibia, characterizing this as an “occupation” that engaged the Geneva Conventions, and the Security Council had expressly called for South Africas withdrawal. /n/nIn a later resolution, after condemning South Africas non-compliance with the earlier resolutions, the Security Council had also declared that “the continued presence of the South African authorities in Namibia is illegal”. This is to be understood as a reference to illegality under the rules on the use of force. Notably, the United States voted in favour of this resolution. With respect to Palestine, however, it now appears to wish to limit those rules to governing the lawfulness of the “the initial resort to force” “leading to an occupation” only. Of course, that could not be correct, including because it would allow an aggressor to benefit from an ongoing attempt to acquire territory through annexation. /n/nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court found that South Africas application of the apartheid régime to occupied territories amounted to disowning the Mandate. In this connection, the Court relied on a context specific expression of the general principle that no State can benefit from its own wrong, stating “[o]ne of the fundamental principles governing the international relationship thus established is that a party which disowns or does not fulfil its own obligations cannot be recognized as retaining the rights which it claims to derive from the relationship”. /n/nSouth Africa had claimed it had an independent right to administer the territory by reason of its “long occupation”. Evidently, the Court disagreed. Three points follow from this. /n/nFirst, the Court in Namibia case implicitly recognized that neither the fact of an occupation nor the law of occupation confer upon the occupying Power any legal entitlement to administer the territory. Any contrary view would allow an occupying Power to benefit from its unlawful use of force. /n/nSecond, the Court made a positive finding that South Africas occupation was unlawful. In Namibia, there was a binding Security Council decision to that effect. The Security Council has made no such Security Council decision with respect to Palestine. But this in no way displaces or impedes the Courts judicial function in determining this legal question for itself. /n/nThird, the Court plainly did not consider that South Africas continued status as an occupying Power made any difference. /n/nAs Judge Greenwood has explained, the basic position under the law of occupation is that an occupying Power has the “liberty to govern within certain limits without being guilty of a violation of the ius in bello”. The occupying Power is required to administer the territory as a temporary conservator or trustee for the benefit of the occupied population. Acting in that capacity, the occupying Power has certain liberties to take measures in good faith in the best interests of the occupied population or, where absolutely necessary, to meet its own legitimate security interests. This, of course, is a separate question to the unlawfulness of the occupation itself. /n/nAs to the position under the law of occupation, again, it is helpful to recall the Namibia case. The Courts context specific expression of the principle was that “a party which disowns or does not fulfil its own obligations cannot be recognized as retaining the rights which it claims to derive from the relationship”. Pakistan considers that this has relevance when considering whether an occupying Power should be recognized as retaining liberties to administer the occupied territory. /n/nIn this case, if one were to zoom in exclusively on Israels conduct as an occupying Power, the only conclusion could be that Israel has disowned its basic duties. Its policies and practices of occupation deny the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and amount to systematic racial discrimination and serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights. Plainly, they cannot be said to be absolutely necessary to meet Israels own security interests. They serve Israels other interests, including its goal of acquiring the territory."

      "texto": "The Court has heard various competing submissions this week with respect to question (b) of the request, but there can be little doubt as to the central importance of three matters: /n/n(a) First, the role of the rules on the use of force in governing the unlawfulness of a given occupation itself. /n/n(b) Second, the series of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions that have consistently and expressly called for Israels withdrawal and referred to “the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war”, which is a corollary of those rules. /n/n(c) Third, the Courts Advisory Opinion on Namibia is a helpful reference point for the Court. /n/nAs to this case, if the Court agrees with Pakistan and with many other States that Israel is in continued breach of these fundamental primary obligations, it cannot allow Israel to benefit from its own ongoing wrongs by somehow avoiding the natural consequences that must follow under this law of State responsibility. These include the obligations of cessation and non-repetition which require immediate and unconditional withdrawal, as well as the obligations of non-recognition and non-assistance for all other States. /n/nAs to the applicable primary rules, it is customary international law and the Charter that govern the illegality of a given occupation at any point in time. As a separate matter, international humanitarian law governs the conduct of an occupying Power with respect to the occupied population. /n/nBut if the occupation itself is unlawful, that carries legal consequences for Israel and for all States under the secondary rules of State responsibility. Those legal consequences are in no way displaced by separate consideration of the lawfulness under international humanitarian law of particular conduct in the course of the occupation, much less by hope for a negotiated solution. Any other approach would effectively permit Israel to benefit from its own wrongdoing. /n/nFor the same reason, there is no scope for an argument that other States, in their dealings with respect to Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territory, could somehow put to one side the question of the unlawfulness of the occupation itself. They could not, for example, elect instead to focus exclusively on the different questions of whether specific Israeli measures were absolutely necessary to meet legitimate security requirements such that those measures are not unlawful under international humanitarian law. /n/nIndeed, in its 1971 Advisory Opinion, the Court itself concluded that, “the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia [is] illegal”. The Court held that South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw immediately and that all States were under an obligation to recognize the illegality of the occupation. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court. I conclude. With the general principle that no State can benefit from its own wrong firmly in mind, it cannot be right that, as some States have suggested, the Court should refrain from finding that the occupation itself is unlawful or that there is no obligation to withdraw. This would be to allow Israel to profit from its own continued grave wrongs. And, to adopt the Courts words in Namibia, the Court “would be failing in the discharge of its judicial functions”. Such abdication of responsibility would not encourage or facilitate the achievement of a negotiated solution on the basis of international law. More generally, the Court would be sending out a clear signal to other States that they too might be allowed to benefit through the prolonged unlawful occupation of the territory of another State."

In the Wall case, this Court observed that the two-State solution was to be encouraged “with a view to achieving as soon as possible, on the basis of international law, a negotiated solution to the outstanding problems and the establishment of a Palestinian State, existing side by side with Israel and its other neighbours, with peace and security for all in the region”. Pakistan supports this call. /n/nOn 26 October 2023, Pakistan was pleased to vote in favour of the General Assembly resolution which reaffirmed that: “a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved . . . in accordance with international law, and on the basis of the two-State solution”. Two months later, on 22 December 2023, the Security Council reiterated its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two States, consistent with international law and relevant United Nations resolutions. /n/nAnd these — and numerous other — resolutions by the political organs of the United Nations make clear, a two-State solution, and negotiations leading to it, must be consistent with international law. “Negotiations”, Judge Al-Khasawneh of this Court observed in the Wall case, “are a means to an end and cannot in themselves replace that end”. He continued to say that the discharge of fundamental international obligations cannot be made conditional upon negotiations. /n/nIn this regard, the Courts advisory opinion in these proceedings will be most important. Far from impeding negotiations and the achievement of a just and lasting two States, the Courts advisory opinion will further assist such efforts, by making it possible for the parties to make progress on the sound basis of international law and international legitimacy."

It is also in breach of the principles of necessity and proportionality. /n/nIt is indeed against the prohibition of aggression, a peremptory norm of international law, from which no derogation is permitted /n/nSecond, the illegal annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nAs an occupying Power, Israel is legally obliged to keep its occupation temporary. /n/nThis has been violated by Israel as it has been attempting to make its occupation permanent and also to annex parts of the occupied territory. /n/nAs a matter of law, under no circumstances shall Israel be allowed to annex any part of the occupied territory. /n/nThe United Nations Security Council, in its various resolutions, has reaffirmed the established principle that acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible. /n/nIt is an absolute principle that applies even in circumstances where war has been resorted to lawfully, such as in self-defence, which is certainly not the case for Israel. /n/nIsraels transgression to international law does not stop there as it has declared that Jerusalem is the “eternal undivided capital” of Israel /n/nNot only are these actions unlawful, they are also highly prejudicial to the prospect of a two-State solution. /n/nThird, continued expansion of illegal settlement. /n/nThe policy of Israel in transferring its own population and forcibly displacing Palestinians from the occupied territory contravenes the fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. /n/nThe policy of Israel in transferring its own population and forcibly displacing Palestinians from the occupied territory contravenes the fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. /n/nIt is worsened by Israels pursuit to change the demographic composition of the West Bank. /n/nThis policy demonstrates Israels complete disregard of international law and also shows the intention to make the situation irreversible. /n/nFourth, the apartheid policy against the Palestinians. /n/nAs an occupying Power, Israel is legally obliged to act in the best interest of the Palestinians. /n/nInstead, Israel has been reinforcing its prolonged occupation by imposing military orders on the Palestinian population which are not applied to Jewish Israeli settlers. /n/nThe existence of separate legal régimes that are applied exclusively on different groups of people is a textbook apartheid policy that constitutes a grave violation of human rights, particularly crimes against humanity. /n/nHaving said that, it is clear that the continuation of such apartheid régime is paramount to another breach of a peremptory norm of international law. /n/nThis should begin with respect to the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, particularly the right to self-determination which has been systematically denied by Israel. /n/nIt follows that we must bring this illegal situation to an end."

      "texto": "Today, Palestinians have had to endure the seizure of their land and property, illegal settlements, unlawful killings, forced displacement, drastic movement restrictions, the denial of refugees right to return and of equal nationality and citizenship. The lived reality of the people of Palestine evokes painful memories for many Namibians of my generation. Namibians still experience the entrenched and structural impact of inequality, as a direct consequence of colonialism and the prolonged unlawful occupation. /n/nMr President, Members of the Court, we ask you not to look away, either. Rather, we appeal to you: once again, end a historic and ongoing injustice by upholding the fundamental rights of a dispossessed people who have endured 57 years of a suffocating occupation. Today, Palestinians are enduring collective punishment in the besieged Gaza Strip, with civilians being killed in continuous and indiscriminate bombardments at a scale that is unprecedented in recent history. This state of affairs — this “hell on earth” — represents a stain on the collective conscience of the world. /n/nFirst, in so far as the law of occupation envisages any belligerent occupation as a temporary measure, immediately following military operations, Israels prolonged — or permanent — occupation breaches the law of occupation. It is a de facto annexation in all but name. /n/nSecond, Israels occupation, in and of itself, is unlawful under general international law. This is because it violates the Charter of the United Nations and peremptory norms; specifically, the prohibition on territorial acquisitions through illegal use of force, the principle of self-determination, and the prohibition of apartheid. /n/nThird, successive resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have declared Israels occupation to be illegal and called on Israel to end it immediately. These resolutions provide an independent source of authority for the illegality of the occupation. /n/nFinally, the continuation of the illegal occupation does not absolve Israel of its obligations and responsibilities under international law. This is consistent with your own conclusions in the Namibia Advisory Opinion that “[p]hysical control of a territory, and not sovereignty or legitimacy of title, is the basis of State liability for acts affecting other States”. /n/nWe also do so on account of the fundamental importance of the Courts 1971 Namibia Opinion, where this Court declared that the policies of apartheid “constitute a denial of fundamental human rights” and are “a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the [United Nations] Charter”. /n/nBut above all, we do this because, notwithstanding the egregious nature of apartheid — as a State delict, as a violation of a peremptory norm and as a crime — it has received virtually no clarification beyond the specific circumstances of southern Africa. An advisory opinion on threshold questions of apartheid will therefore assist the General Assembly in respect of its own action, in identifying the key elements of the illegality and in formulating appropriate responses to Israels discriminatory practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. /n/nFirst, we respectfully ask the Court to make it clear that the prohibition of apartheid is not limited to southern Africa in the last century. It extends to Israels policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory today. Article 3 of CERD places all States parties, including Israel, under an obligation to prevent, prohibit and eradicate apartheid “in territories under their jurisdiction”. This is also the conclusion of the CERD Committee. The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, negotiated after the end of apartheid in South Africa, also recognized apartheid as a crime against humanity without temporal or geographical restriction. /n/nSecond, the Court should also confirm that the prohibition of apartheid binds all States as a peremptory norm. In your decision in the case under CERD brought by Qatar against United Arab Emirates, you acknowledged the “universal character [of CERD] is confirmed by the fact that 182 States are parties to it”. The International Law Commission and its Special Rapporteur on jus cogens (as Judge Tladi then was) have also expressly recognized the peremptory character of the prohibition of apartheid. /n/nFinally, Namibia invites the Court to clarify the definition of apartheid. Namibia aligns itself with other participants that the definition in Article 2 of the Apartheid Convention incorporates the three key elements of the delict under international law. /n/nFirst, the State must engage in one or more “inhuman acts”. Crucially, these take the form of violations of fundamental human rights within an institutionalized framework of systematic oppression and domination. /n/nSecond, these inhuman acts must be directed against a “racial group” or its members. /n/nFinally, the State must commit these inhuman acts “for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination” by one racial group over the other and “systematically oppressing them”. /n/nOther participants have already made extensive statements on the discriminatory and inhuman acts carried out against the Palestinians as a racial group. These policies and practices are too many to enumerate in the time available. They include laws that discriminate in matters of citizenship, ownership and transfer of property, and freedom of movement. The systematic and excessive use of force against Palestinian civilians, the arbitrary killings and mass incarceration of Palestinians, including children; the illegal settlements; the discriminatory residency regulations; and, crucially, the denial of a Palestinian identity by refusing to recognize them as a people with a right to determine their own political destiny and to pursue social, economic and cultural development. /n/nNamibias submission will focus on the final requirement: the purpose of establishing, maintaining domination and systematic oppression. First, the term “domination” signifies a pervasive, all-encompassing, serious form of control over a group. Second, “oppression” implies prolonged cruelty, reflecting a sustained violation of human rights. Third, “systematic” implies the organized nature of violent acts and the improbability of their random occurrence. /n/nNamibia shares the view of other participants that Israels policies and practices meet the evidentiary standard for establishing the State delict of apartheid. The Israeli Governments openly articulated aim is to ensure Jewish Israeli control of all facets of Palestinian life, as evidenced by legislation affirming Israel as the nation State of the Jewish people, with unique self-determination rights reserved for Jewish individuals only. /n/nIt is clear from all the available evidence that these discriminatory practices are not accidental or fortuitous but are designed for the specific purpose of privileging Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. The fact that the practices in question may have other collateral objectives, such as maintaining security, is irrelevant. It will suffice if the primary motive is discriminatory, even if it also serves ancillary purposes. /n/nIt follows in Namibias submission that Israels policies and practices are inconsistent with the prohibition of apartheid as a State delict under international law. Furthermore, these discriminatory practices, in the context of prolonged occupation of the Palestinian territories, violate the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. /n/nAs other Participants have highlighted, these discriminatory policies and practices are directed at fragmenting the Palestinian people. These elaborate systems of administrative controls undermine group cohesiveness by dividing the Palestinian people into a number of administrative “domains” or groups, with varying degrees of rights. This strategic fragmentation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory into Bantustans makes Palestinian life burdensome and in many cases unbearable, forcing them to leave their homes. /n/nPerhaps the epitome of discriminatory laws negating the Palestinian right of self-determination is the 2018 Basic Law, passed with constitutional status, which boldly declares that Israel is the nation of the Jewish people and that Jewish settlement is a national value. /n/nSince Israels policies and practices violate peremptory norms of international law, the occupation itself is unlawful. This entails consequences for Israel, for third States and, for the United Nations."

And here, Namibia aligns itself with Jordans Written Submission that all States are also under an obligation to recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including by exercising that right within a viable and independent State of Palestine. /n/nIn the Namibia Opinion, you already set out the legal consequences of unlawful occupation. There, you said that, once the Court is faced with an illegal situation, “it would be failing in the discharge of its judicial functions if it did not declare that there is an obligation, especially upon Members of the United Nations, to bring that situation to an end.” /n/nIn that Opinion, you recognized the clear obligation on South Africa to put an end to the illegal occupation and withdraw its administration from the territory. The same consequences must of necessity attach to the illegal occupation by Israel of the Palestinian territories. /n/nMoreover, Namibia reaffirms the position held by the majority of participants that all States are under an obligation not to recognize, assist, support, or contribute to the continuation of the unlawful occupation. This is also in line with your own settled jurisprudence. /n/nIn the Wall Opinion, you confirmed that the obligations of third States include the “obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the [illegal] situation”. That all States must refrain from all forms of assistance, including transfer of arms, and political support that de facto perpetuates the occupation. /n/nIn Namibias view, this means, in particular, that all States are under an obligation to ensure that companies under their jurisdiction or control do not trade in Israeli goods or with Israeli companies originating from or linked to Israels illegal occupation."

      "texto": "Israels occupation of Palestinian Territory has continued since 1967. Recent developments give rise to the utmost concern. They include ongoing indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force and other measures in the Gaza Strip, as well as illegal settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. House evictions, demolitions, forced displacement and settler violence against the Palestinian population are aspects of the Israeli occupation. /n/nSuch acts run counter to fundamental human rights, international humanitarian law and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. They threaten the foundations under international law for the vision of a region where two States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side within secure and recognized borders. Against this background, an advisory opinion will provide essential and timely guidance to the international community /n/nMr President, the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem constitute a chief obstacle to any prospect of settlement and peace in the area. In its Advisory Opinion of 2004 on the legality of the construction of a wall, this Court stated that “the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law”40. The Security Council has in numerous resolutions, including 2334 of 2016, restated its determination that the settlements constitute “a flagrant violation of international law”41 and stressed the need to reverse the negative trends on the ground, which are steadily eroding the two-State solution and entrenching a one-State reality. /n/nAt the outset, we recall that the definition of “occupied territory” in Article 42 of the 1907 Hague Regulations relies on a factual assessment. A territory is considered occupied when it is “actually placed under the authority” of the hostile army. This triggers key legal rules, in particular out of humanitarian considerations, notably pursuant to the Fourth Geneva Convention. /n/nThe factual assessment made by this Court at the time of the Wall Opinion remains, in our view, entirely true today: both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are integral parts of the territory occupied by Israel in 1967, irrespective of the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. The Security Council recently stressed in its resolution 2720 of 2023 “that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967” and reiterated “the vision of the two-State solution, with the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian State”, echoing its resolution 1860 of 2009. /n/nThe protection given to the civilian population by the laws of occupation continue to apply. This does, however, not impede a consideration of the legality of the occupation as such. The occupation has now lasted for more than half a century. While international law does not set any specific time limit, military occupation is, in essence, temporary42. This is evident from provisions such as Articles 6 (3) and 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and was recalled by the General Assembly in its resolution 77/126 in 2022, emphasizing “that the occupation of a territory is to be a temporary, de facto situation, whereby the occupying Power can neither claim possession nor exert its sovereignty over the territory it occupies”. Recognized authorities have reminded us that “the law on belligerent occupation is based on the assumption that occupation of foreign territory, being an extraordinary measure, may be justified for a limited time only”43. /n/nA military occupation cannot be permanent. If an occupation is allowed to be indefinite, then the distinction, under jus ad bellum, between occupation and annexation dissolves. Furthermore, risks are patent with regard to “deportations, transfers and evacuations” in breach of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Both this Court and the Security Council have found Israel to have violated this provision. Such developments give reason to ask whether the situation is turning into a de facto annexation. /n/nIn its Advisory Opinion on the Wall, the Court noted that “the principle of self-determination of peoples has been enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 2625 (XXV) . . ., pursuant to which ‘Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to . . . of their right to self-determination”44. The Court notes in paragraph 149 that Israel is bound to comply with its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. /n/nIt added that there was a risk of further alterations to the demographic composition of the territory, contributing to the departure of Palestinian populations from certain areas. On this basis, the Court concluded that the construction of the wall, along with measures taken previously, severely impeded the exercise by the Palestinian people to its right to self-determination and is therefore a breach of Israels obligation to respect that right. /n/nIn its 2019 Advisory Opinion on Chagos45, paragraph 160, the Court emphasized the customary law character of the right to territorial integrity of a non-self-governing territory as a corollary of the right to self-determination. It follows that any detachment by the administering Power of part of a non-self-governing territory, unless based on the freely expressed and genuine will of the people of that territory, is contrary to the right to self-determination. /n/nNorway believes that permanent or irreversible measures taken by Israel on Occupied Palestinian Territory would likewise be contrary to the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination. /n/nI turn now to annexation. Annexation is a unilateral act by which a State incorporates into its territory all or part of the territory of another. As a concomitant of the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, annexation is prohibited under customary international law. /n/nThis prohibition is reflected in Security Council resolution 242 of 1967, referring to the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war”, repeated in its resolution 298 of 1971. It is on this basis that the Security Council in its resolution 469 of 1980 declared Israels de jure annexation of East Jerusalem to be “invalid”. /n/nWhat form annexation takes is irrelevant. To quote the Court: “With regard to the question of form, it should be observed that this is not a domain in which international law imposes any special or strict requirements”. This is why it must be reiterated that annexation under any form — whether de jure or de facto — is illegal under international law. The formal characterization is immaterial. /n/nNevertheless, there are grounds for asking whether Israels occupation may be seen as tantamount to de facto annexation, as the Court did in the Wall Opinion: “the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a ‘fait accompli on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case, and notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation”46. /n/nIn its September 2022 report, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, held that “Israel treats the occupation as permanent and has — for all intents and purposes — annexed parts of the West Bank, while seeking to hide behind a fiction of temporariness. Actions by Israel constituting de facto annexation include expropriating land and natural resources, establishing settlements and outposts, maintaining a restrictive and discriminatory planning and building regime for Palestinians and extending Israeli law extraterritorially to Israeli settlers in the West Bank.”47 /n/nThe Commission considered the situation tantamount to a de facto annexation, as alluded to by the Court48. /n/nFirst, the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory represents a transfer, over decades, of parts of the occupying Powers own civilian population into the territory it occupies, in breach of Article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Security Council has repeatedly, including in resolution 2334 (2016), condemned all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the territory occupied since 1967. /n/nSecond, it could be asked whether the duration of the occupation, which has now lasted for more than half a century, in itself renders the occupation tantamount to de facto annexation. /n/nThird, there are grounds for serious concerns regarding announced plans for further expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. /n/nFourth, Israel has appropriated natural resources of the West Bank, including water resources, and seized control of the physical infrastructure in order to bind the area closer to itself and, it seems, to render irreversible its presence in the territory49. Of particular concern are the repeated demolitions of the local Palestinian Bedouin communities and plans for infrastructure constructions that will isolate Bethlehem and the southern West Bank from East Jerusalem."

      "pregunta": "Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested",
      "texto": "The Court has held consistently that its advisory jurisdiction cannot be used to undermine the fundamental requirement of State consent. Further, it should not provide “a form of judicial recourse” for parties2. Nor should the Court resolve disputes between parties using its advisory jurisdiction3. Instead, the Courts advisory function is “to offer legal advice to the [UN] organs . . . requesting the opinion”4, “in order to assist them in their activities”5. /n/n Let me be clear: the United Kingdom does not submit that a State whose rights or duties may be affected by an opinion can prevent the Court from giving an opinion. Rather, consistent with the Courts jurisprudence, the United Kingdoms submission is that where a request is “directly related to the main point”6 of a dispute between two parties, then the Court should refrain from giving an opinion. In the words of the Court in Western Sahara, to give an opinion in such a case “would have the effect of circumventing the principle that a State is not obliged to allow its disputes to be submitted to judicial settlement without its consent”7. /n/nIf the Court were to answer the request as currently formulated, it would entail a breach of the non-circumvention principle. /n/nThe United Kingdom makes four key points: /n/n(1) The first point relates to the nature and content of the bilateral dispute. It is more than a mere “difference of views”8. It is a dispute of acute sensitivity. It is long-standing. It concerns the status of Israels occupation, issues of security and the conditions under which Israel can and should withdraw from the Occupied Palestinian Territories9. /n/n(2) Second, the request engages that core dispute. The General Assembly asks the Court to consider in express terms and rule on both the “legal status” of the occupied territories and the “legal consequences” of that status. The Court is also invited to make findings of Israeli responsibility in relation to its “policies and practices”. This engages key “permanent status issues” which are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, including on “Jerusalem”, on “settlements”, on “security arrangements” and on “borders”10. Indeed, a key Participant has described the Assemblys request as “taking the entire Palestine question to be looked at by the highest court in the globe”11. /n/n(3) The third point concerns the relief requested. The Court is asked to determine that Israels occupation is unlawful and to order that Israel should withdraw immediately from the occupied territories as a result12. Over the course of this hearing, the Court has repeatedly been requested to order Israels “immediate, unconditional and total” withdrawal13. This repeated insistence further demonstrates that the Court is being asked to decide the “main point of the dispute”, which several States recognize14. /n/n(4) Finally, Israel has not consented to the main points of the dispute being resolved by this Court15. To the contrary, it has asked the Court to refuse to respond to the request16. Given the content of the request as currently formulated, there is thus no basis on which the Court should answer it. /n/nFirst, they say the Court can determine key issues relating to the parties bilateral dispute because it is of broader concern to the United Nations. Their argument relies on the Courts recognition in the Wall Opinion17 that the General Assembly has a “permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine”18. The result, they say, is that the request arises in a “much broader frame of reference than a bilateral dispute”19. /n/nWith respect, the United Kingdom disagrees. The General Assemblys consideration of a bilateral dispute does not mean that the non-circumvention principle is inapplicable. If it did, the principle would never apply in any advisory proceedings, since any bilateral dispute on which the Assembly made a request would always fall within the so-called “broader frame of reference”20. Such an approach would deprive the non-circumvention principle of all practical application. /n/nThis approach of the United Kingdom is consistent with the Wall Opinion. That opinion did not concern the core aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The Court itself accepted that it could not properly address what it referred to as “the greater whole” of the dispute21. Judge Higgins characterized that approach as “wise and correct”22. Judge Koroma was careful to distinguish the request in the Wall case from any such broader request that concerned “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as such” or “its resolution”23. And Judge Owada accepted that the Courts answer should not “be tantamount to adjudicating on the very subject-matter of the underlying concrete bilateral dispute that currently undoubtedly exists between Israel and Palestine”24. /n/n A related point that several Participants have advanced is that the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is multilateral in character because it concerns erga omnes obligations25. The fact that a bilateral dispute may involve obligations in which States have a collective interest does not obviate the need for consent for that dispute to be resolved before the Court. Nor does it change the fact that there are two participants involved in that bilateral dispute. /n/nThe second counter-argument on non-circumvention is that the non-binding nature of advisory opinions means that a Court can opine on a bilateral dispute26. Like the first argument, this would deprive the non-circumvention principle of all practical application. By definition, Mr President, all advisory opinions are non-binding and so the principle would never apply in any advisory proceedings. /n/nThis ignores that the Court is being asked to make findings about Israels liability and responsibility for various alleged breaches of international law that are central to the bilateral dispute. The Court would in substance be deciding on the “main points” of the dispute if it were to answer the request as formulated, and that is precisely the problem that the non-circumvention principle is intended to avoid. /n/nThis submission also ignores that serious legal consequences may result from the Courts findings27. This risk is even more pronounced since several Participants ask the Court to make legal determinations for the express purpose of clarifying the law relevant to the parties negotiations28. /n/nIn sum, the principle of non-circumvention is engaged in this case. Mr President, Members of the Court, if this fundamental legal principle is ever to have any real meaning or application, the Court must decline to answer the request as currently formulated."

      "texto": "The United Kingdom confines its submissions to relevant matters of legal principle, firmly founded on the Courts own jurisprudence. We submit that the terms of the request do not allow the Court to give an opinion in a manner consistent with its judicial functions. The United Kingdom will focus today on three key points concerning propriety, which will be developed by Professor Sarooshi. They are: /n/n(1) first, the impact of the non-circumvention principle in this case; /n/n(2) second, the unsuitability of the fact-finding exercise that the Court would have to conduct to answer the request as presently framed; /n/n(3) third, the effect of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338. /n/nEach of these points independently provides a cogent reason for declining to answer the request. /n/nThe Court will have observed that our third reason has occupied a particularly prominent place in the Participants oral submissions. Should the Court be minded to issue an opinion, then the United Kingdom would respectfully urge it to reformulate the questions to concentrate on the Security Council framework. In this scenario, the Court should focus on assisting the General Assembly in supporting urgent progress towards a negotiated solution. I will address this point in concluding the United Kingdoms submissions later. /n/nAllow me to highlight a few features of the factual determination process in this case: /n/n(1) The request in the present case makes no attempt to set out its factual basis. This stands in stark contrast to the Wall Opinion. In that case, the request by the General Assembly was based on assumed facts described in a single report by the United Nations Secretary-General31. /n/n(2) As one key Participant accepts, and as the Courts jurisprudence reflects32, this means that “it is for the Court, in exercising its judicial function, to independently evaluate the factual materials that have been submitted to it”33. /n/n(3) In this case, the request asks the Court to determine a long list of legal issues and make the necessary factual findings to support them. This is by reference to the entire factual record stretching back some 57 years and a United Nations dossier spanning nearly 30,000 pages34. /n/n(4) As a matter of practicality, it is unclear how the Court can properly make the broad range of findings required to answer the request and consider such a volume of material especially when exercising its advisory jurisdiction where the Court cannot “fall back upon considerations of burden of proof”35. /n/n(5) It is no answer to assume that the Court can defer to the reports of United Nations bodies36. The Court must reach its own independent findings of fact. We emphasize that several States, including the United Kingdom37, have expressed reservations about these United Nations reports. /n/n(6) The Courts task is further complicated by a factual landscape that is rapidly shifting in the context of an ongoing and active conflict38. This creates the serious risk that the Court may draw legal conclusions on an incorrect factual basis. /n/n(7) The problem is further heightened by the gravity of the accusations levelled against Israel, where it is not a party and where the proceedings have been expedited39. As this Court has long recognized, “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive”40. /n/nIn sum, the United Kingdom submits that there is a serious risk that the Court may undermine its judicial function by giving an advisory opinion in such a context. /n/nIn response to this submission, three main points have been raised by other Participants: /n/n(1) First, it is said, the negotiation process has been stalled for some time49. This does not negate the validity of the Security Council framework. Nor does it change the reality that a negotiated solution under the United Nations auspices is the only possible way in which this conflict will be resolved. It underscores the need to strengthen that process, rather than undermine it. /n/n(2) Second, some participants50 have referred to the Courts jurisprudence on whether it should take account of adverse political consequences when considering propriety. The Courts jurisprudence requires there to be an objective basis to assess the relevance of such consequences51. In this case, there is an objective basis. It is the established Security Council framework52. The General Assemblys general mandate in respect of the Palestinian question cannot override the Security Council framework. /n/n(3) Third, it is argued that an opinion will not interfere with the Security Council framework or with negotiations conducted under its auspices. Instead, it is claimed, an opinion will assist that process53. Participants rely on the Courts statement in the Wall Opinion that the negotiations must be conducted “in accordance with international law”54 and equivalent language in Council resolutions55. And so the Courts legal conclusions can and should, they say, “constrain” the bases on which those negotiations are conducted56. With respect, Mr President, this argument is flawed: /n/n(a) It would undermine the very premise of the Councils framework if the Court were to address the status of the occupation and require Israels withdrawal. As I observed earlier, that framework inextricably links withdrawal with security and applies on a reciprocal basis. An “unconditional” order directed at only one party contradicts that fundamental requirement. It also undermines the additional premise that Israeli withdrawal will be achieved by negotiation, rather than by a Court opinion. /n/n(b) Furthermore, an opinion addressing the parties obligations would prejudice their negotiating positions and thus contravene the Courts injunction in the Interpretation of Peace Treaties and the Western Sahara Advisory Opinions that “the legal position of the parties to [a dispute] cannot be in any way compromised by the answers that the Court may give to the questions put to it”57. /n/nFor these reasons, the United Kingdom respectfully requests the Court to decline the request as presently formulated. /n/nThe United Kingdom agrees with those States that urge the Court not to cause prejudice to the existing Security Council framework64 or to decide any aspect of the parties bilateral dispute65. Like other participants66, the United Kingdom recognizes that an alternative route to respect propriety is to reinterpret the request or reformulate its terms. There is no question that the Court has the power to proceed in this way. It has “often been required to . . . interpret and even reformulate the questions put”67. As Judge Tomka has acknowledged, the Court can avoid intruding on a bilateral dispute by narrowing the scope of its answer68. /n/nThe question for the Court is how best to achieve these aims. We propose that the Courts opinion should focus on endorsing the continued application of the agreed framework, with a view to ensuring its urgent implementation. An answer of this kind would respect the three propriety limitations that we have identified. It would also assist the General Assembly to discharge its mandate on “the Palestinian question”, which many participants have emphasized is the object of this request69. /n/nMore specifically, the United Kingdom in this alternative submission respectfully invites the Court to do the following: /n/n(1) to endorse the continued application of the Security Council framework to both parties and the need for its urgent implementation at the earliest possible opportunity; /n/n(2) to recall both parties obligations to respect the terms of the Councils framework; /n/n(3) to recall both parties agreement not to aggravate their dispute by taking any step to change the status or integrity of the Occupied Territories until a negotiated solution is agreed70; and lastly /n/n(4) to reaffirm the parties obligations in their interim agreements that they negotiate on permanent status issues. /n/nIn this way, the Court could assist the General Assembly in achieving its stated objective, which is to support urgent progress towards a negotiated solution within the Security Council framework. The United Kingdom reiterates that a negotiated two-State solution is the only way in which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be resolved."

Nevertheless, the Court has consistently dismissed such objections. /n/nAs recalled by the Court in the Chagos Advisory Opinion, “[t]he fact that the Court has jurisdiction does not mean, however, that it is obliged to exercise it”. /n/nAccording to consistent jurisprudence of this Court, the discretion whether or not to respond to a request for an advisory opinion exists to safeguard the judicial function of the Court as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. /n/nHowever, the Court is aware that its reply to a request “represents its participation in the Organization, and, in principle, should not be refused”.

The Court acknowledged that regardless of its conclusions, they would introduce an additional aspect to the negotiations. However, the Court stated that the ultimate effect of its Opinion is a matter of appreciation and cannot be seen as a compelling reason to refuse exercising its jurisdiction. This jurisprudential principle was confirmed by this Court in the Advisory Opinion on the Wall. /n/nThere is an additional pivotal aspect to address in this context. The two questions central to the ongoing advisory proceedings pertain to the existing conditions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court is not tasked with determining the content of a final settlement or the precise boundaries of the Palestinian State. /n/nEssentially, the request seeks the Court to provide an authoritative legal opinion on the current legal ramifications of the practices and policies of Israel referred to in the request. The advisory opinion is expected to bear relevance to extant queries regarding legal status and its associated consequences. Such clarification holds the potential to significantly contribute to establishing the groundwork for a prospective negotiated resolution of the underlying conflict, rather than to endanger the established framework for negotiations that have been suspended for several years now. Hence, the Sudan believes that this does not constitute a compelling reason to decline responding to the request./n/nIt is well-established jurisprudence of this Court that the lack of consent to the Courts contentious jurisdiction by interested States does not impact the Courts jurisdiction to render an advisory opinion. /n/nThis rationale is exemplified by instances such as when the Court gave its Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara, even in the absence of Spains consent to the request; when it delivered the Advisory Opinion on the Wall despite Israel not providing consent; and when it issued the Chagos Advisory Opinion, notwithstanding the absence of consent from the United Kingdom. In each of these instances the Court gave its opinions, even though the requests concerned the responsibility of particular States. /n/nThe General Assembly has consistently played a crucial role in matters concerning Palestine, as evident from the documentation presented in the Secretary-Generals dossier before this Court. The Palestinian people are yet to realize their right to self-determination, a fact that no State can plausibly contest. Therefore, the Sudan believes that the objection to the General Assemblys exercise of its competence in the realm of self-determination and its consideration of the situation in Palestine is unpersuasive. /n/nIn the light of the foregoing, the Sudan concludes that the Court not only has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly, but also that there is no compelling reason for this Court to use its discretionary power not to give the opinion. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Members of the Court."

In advisory proceedings conducted before this Court, wherein the exercise of this right was a pivotal concern, the Courts opinion emerged as fundamental elements shaping the legal framework for resolving the underlying disputes, such as the one concerning Namibia. If only we had a comparable equivalent for Palestine. The successful resolution of the protracted dispute surrounding Namibia can be largely attributed to the Courts judicial task. It is respectfully suggested that you should persist in fulfilling that role in the present advisory proceedings."

      "texto": "Today, the practices of Israel, the occupying Power, are definitely the clearest reflection — unfortunately — of the failure of the international community to prevent the heinous crime of occupation and to ensure the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. /n/nThe Syrian Arab Republic stresses the need to hold Israel accountable for its grave and continuing violations of the provisions of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and its relevant resolutions, and the provisions of international humanitarian law, including provisions in Section III of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, Articles 47 and what follows. /n/nThe right to self-determination is a fundamental human right that is enshrined, among other international instruments and conventions, in Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, providing that each State shall “refrain from any forced action depriving peoples . . . of their right to self-determination, freedom and independence” and that each State shall “encourage, through joint and unilateral action, the realization of the principle . . . of self-determination of peoples”. /n/nThis right is also reiterated and affirmed in common Article 1 between the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which obliges States that are parties to these Covenants to promote the realization and respect of this right, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. /n/nIsrael violates this right through, for example, the establishment and continued expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem. We note in particular the discriminatory Israeli legislation of 2018, or what is called the Basic Law: “Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People”, which recognizes the right to self-determination exclusively for the “Jewish people”, denying the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination on their land and in their homeland. I shall now turn to talk about the legal consequences. /n/nThe illegal Israeli settlements and the system associated with them are based actually on a dual process: on one hand, the forced displacement of Palestinians and the confiscation of their lands. And on the other hand, the transfer of Israeli settlers and the construction and expansion of settlements on confiscated lands. /n/nInternational humanitarian law prohibits the forced displacement of the occupied people and the transfer of citizens of the occupying Power to the occupied territories, as confirmed by Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention that provides for the protection of civilians in the time of war, thus forced displacement and transfer of citizens by the occupying Power constitute grave violations under Article 147 of the aforementioned Convention. /n/nIndeed, the actual annexation of parts of the occupied Palestinian land is embodied through a continuous gradual process involving the implementation of many measures and actions that include, among others, /n/n(a) settlements size, infrastructure, and location, which indicate the purpose to make them sustainable; /n/n(b) “Israeli” government plans and directives that allowed the establishment and expansion of settlements; /n/n(c) the legislation that enacted a dual legal system in the occupied territories in favour of the settlers at the expense of the occupied people, including the “Basic Law” of 2018: “Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People”. /n/n(d) another example: public statements of Israeli officials demonstrate to the fact that the settlements and the system associated with them constitute a deliberate policy of obtaining a permanent presence for the annexation of the territories and confirm that the actual annexation had already taken place; /n/n(e) the guidelines and coalition agreements of the new Israeli occupation authorities sworn in on 29 December 2022, in which they explicitly declare that the Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all areas of “Israel” and undertake to strengthen and develop settlements throughout what they called the “land of Israel” — in the Galilee, the Negev, the West Bank — and in the occupied Syrian Golan, despite the confirmation by United Nations Security Council resolution 497 (1981) that provides that “the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect”. /n/nMr. President, distinguished Members of the Court, in 1980 the Israeli Knesset adopted a “basic law” on Jerusalem, which states that “Jerusalem, whole and united” is the “capital of Israel”, effectively annexing the city, in flagrant violation of international law and of the Citys own international status. /n/nIn response, the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 478, which declared that “all legislative and administrative measures, and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and in particular the recent ‘basic law on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith”. Mr. President, since then, the Israeli occupation authorities have worked to consolidate further annexation instead of reversing it. /n/nSince its inception, “Israel” has adopted various discriminatory legislations aimed to ensuring its control over the maximum geography with the minimum possible number of Palestinians. /n/nThe United Nations Human Rights Council has described the “Israeli” discriminatory measures as “(1) a combination of movement restrictions consisting of the wall, checkpoints, a permit system that affects only the Palestinian population, (2) and the application of a two-tier legal system that facilitated the establishment and consolidation of settlements, (3) and other violations and forms of institutional discrimination”. /n/nThe United Nations General Assembly has always, and for many years, condemned, in a large number of resolutions, the discriminatory policies and practices of “Israel”, the occupying Power, against the Palestinians, as well as the Syrians in the occupied Syrian Arab Golan. These policies and practices include, according to these resolutions, “killing and injuring civilians, arbitrary arrests and detentions, in addition to forced displacement of civilians, transfer of settlers to the occupied Palestinian and Syrian territories, destruction and confiscation of civilian properties and demolishing homes”. /n/nYour honours, in the devastated Gaza Strip, long before 7 October 2023, “Israel” practices racial discrimination towards the Palestinian population in the form of its ongoing blockade. The discriminatory nature of the blockade actually imposed on the Gaza Strip was recognized by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This blockade was found to violate the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. /n/nThe actions of Israel are part of a large-scale, repressive, organized and systematic régime. Such actions have been identified as apartheid after a thorough factual and legal examination by the United Nations special procedures and by various international organizations. Apartheid is most manifested in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, where illegally located settlers benefit from far-reaching privileges at the expense of the basic rights of the Palestinian people. /n/nThe acts and practices of occupying Powers are strictly regulated by international law and international humanitarian law. Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates that “the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population to the territories it occupies”. /n/nWhile the occupying Power is obliged under international law to administer the territory for the benefit of the people under its occupation, Israel administers the territory only for the benefit of its settlers, and even to ensure the sustainability of the illegal occupation of others lands. /n/nWhile annexations or claims of sovereignty over territories under the interim administrative authorities of the occupying Power are strictly prohibited, Israel has sought to exercise fait accompli sovereignty over Jerusalem and the occupied Arab territories. /n/nMr. President, distinguished Members of this honourable Court, we believe, in the first place, that the Israeli occupation, in and of itself, should be considered absolutely illegal, and that we should not be satisfied with only and merely describing its practices and policies. Allow me now to move to the legal consequences. /n/nHonourable judges, the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms the principle that States shall not obtain legal rights from unilateral acts that do not comply with international law. Syria also re-emphasizes the temporary nature of the occupation, and that even if it is a fait accompli, this does not and will not give the occupying Power the right to acquire sovereignty over the occupied territories, no matter how long this brutal occupation lasts. /n/nIsrael is not only committing the horrendous acts that we have just mentioned, but we are currently witnessing Israel committing genocide in the occupied Gaza Strip, attacking Syria, attacking Lebanon, and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. In fact, one of the reasons for Israels consideration of itself as being above the law is that it has been carrying out illegal occupation and committing crimes for 75 years, without facing accountability or any sort of consequences."

Israels decades-long occupation has not only led to deprivation of Palestinian people of their fundamental rights, but also made them dependent on Israels mercy. Their properties are demolished, their land is usurped, their livelihoods are confiscated. Although they are living in the twenty-first century, the practices they have been subjected to are from the Middle Ages and sometimes even worse. Today, the Palestinian people only need emancipation and dignity. /n/nIsraels ongoing occupation and Israels ongoing and deliberately prolonged occupation and intransigent policies failing all initiatives have also left the Palestinians, who were expelled from homeland to neighbouring countries, in limbo, in despair and hopelessness  generation after generation. /n/nWe believe that all the unilateral acts and measures by Israel aimed at changing the character and status of the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, constitute a breach of international law and must be unconditionally rescinded. /n/nBy the same token, the situation in the occupied territories has not improved, despite numerous resolutions that the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council resolutions adopted over decades. Israels unlawful unilateral actions, that are considered null and void in many of the United Nations resolutions, are continuously putting the two-State vision in jeopardy. /n/nUnlawful settlement activity has intensified to the extent that it is now extremely difficult to mention contiguity of the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, which is a key to a lasting peace. /n/nTransfer of Israeli population in the form of settlements has been changing the demographic composition of the occupied territories. Demolition of houses of the Palestinians as well as forcible evacuations continue under the protection of the Israeli security forces. Also, settler violence is increasing day by day against native Palestinians. /n/nLocated in East Jerusalem, the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram Al-Sharif, is among the holiest sites for Muslims around the world. Therefore, its sanctity as a Muslim shrine must be upheld as sacrosanct at all times. /n/nThe historical status quo at the holy places in Jerusalem, including in Haram Al-Sharif was established during the Ottoman era and has remained in place ever since. /n/nOn 4 April 2023, Israeli security forces stormed the Al Aqsa Mosque, beat up worshippers and detained hundreds of them altogether during the holy month of Ramadan. This kind of brutal practice is becoming commonplace. /n/nOn 5 June 1967, Israel launched a military offensive and occupied the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegally. In the following period, several United Nations Security Council1 and General Assembly resolutions affirmed that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible under international law and “confirmed that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel which purport to alter the status of Jerusalem, including expropriation of lands and properties thereon, are invalid and cannot change that status”. /n/nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, basically, Israel is the occupying Power in the occupied Palestinian territories and under the obligation to abide by international law. Therefore, any Israeli acts and/or measures executed in the occupied Palestinian territories in breach of international law should be considered null and void. The practices as well as acts and measures violating human rights must be held to account. /n/nSince 7 October, more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far in Israels indiscriminate attacks on Gaza. Most of them are women and children. 2.3 million civilians have been placed under full blockade by Israel, depriving them of their basic needs to survive, such as water, food, medicine, fuel and electricity. Hospitals, refugee camps, schools, places of worship, churches and mosques have been targeted unsparingly. Around two million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced."

      "texto": "The persistence of this occupation, acts of genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, crimes against humanity, displacement of populations, imprisonment of Palestinians behind illegal segregation walls, expansion of illegal settlements, creating new political realities on the ground aiming at complicating the dismantling of the occupation  all  will never discourage Palestinians from claiming their legitimate inalienable rights. /n/nThe insistence on placing Israel above the law, through the politicization of accountability and adopting double standards in the application of justice is a direct threat to international peace and stability./n/nThis prolonged occupation is an affront to international justice. The failure to bring it to an end has led to the current horrors perpetrated against the Palestinian people, amounting to genocide. There can be no moral or juridical justification for occupying lands, killing, terrorizing and displacing their populations. /n/nWhen this began after the First World War, the Jewish population of that land was 11 per cent. Forcibly implementing Zionism in this demographic context has necessarily involved the extermination, or forced displacement of, some of the non-Jewish Palestinian population; the exercise of domination over, and subjugation, dispossession and immiseration of, remaining non-Jewish Palestinians; the emigration to that land of Jewish people, regardless of any direct personal link; and the denial of Palestinian refugees the right to return. All operating through a racist distinction privileging Jewish people over non-Jewish Palestinian people. /n/nThis has necessitated serious violations of all the fundamental, jus cogens and erga omnes norms of international law — the right of self-determination, the prohibitions on aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity, racial discrimination, apartheid and torture  and the core protections of international humanitarian law. /n/nDespite this, a State of Israel, specifically for Jewish people, was proclaimed in 1948 by those controlling 78 per cent — more than three quarters — of Palestine, accompanied by the forced displacement of a significant number of the non-Jewish Palestinian population — the Nakba, catastrophe. This illegal secession was an egregious violation of Palestinian self-determination. Israels statehood was recognized, and Israel admitted as a United Nations Member, despite this illegality. Israel is not the legal continuation or successor of the Mandate. /n/nFirst, Palestinian people not displaced from the land proclaimed to be of Israel in 1948, and their descendants, have been forced to live as citizens — presently they constitute 17.2 per cent — of a State conceived to be of and for another racial group, under the domination of that group, necessarily treated as second class, because of their race. /n/nSecond, Palestinian people displaced from that land, and their descendants, cannot return /n/nFor more than half a century, then, a State defined to be of and for Jewish people exclusively has governed the entire land of historic Palestine and the Palestinian people there. And the régime of racial domination — apartheid — and denying return, has been extended throughout. In the case of Palestinians living in the occupied territory, this has involved the same serious violations of international law, supplemented by serious violations of norms applicable in occupied territory. /n/nIndeed, these people are subject to an even more extreme form of racist domination, as they are not even citizens of the State exercising authority over them. Even in East Jerusalem, which Israel has purported to annex, the majority non-Jewish Palestinian residents do not have citizenship, whereas Jewish residents, including illegal settlers, are citizens. /n/nFirst, the law on the use of force. Here, the occupation is illegal both as a use of force without valid justification, and because it is enabling an illegal purported annexation. As such, it is an aggression. /n/nSecond, the law of self-determination. Here, it is illegal again because of the association with illegal purported annexation, and also, more generally, because it is, quite simply, an exercise of authority over the Palestinian people that, by its very nature, violates their right to freedom."

To end this serious illegality, it must be terminated: Israel must renounce all sovereignty claims and all settlements must be removed. Immediately. /n/nBeginning with self-determination: this right, when applied to the Palestinian people in the territory Israel captured in 1967, is a right to be entirely self-governing, free from Israeli domination. /n/nConsequently, the Palestinian people have a legal right to the immediate end of the occupation.

It does not depend on others agreeing to its realization. It is a right. /n/nIsrael cannot lawfully demand concessions on Palestinian rights as the price for ending its impediment to Palestinian freedom. This would mean Israel using force to coerce the Palestinian people to give up some of their peremptory legal rights: illegal in the law on the use of force and, necessarily, voiding the relevant terms of any agreement reached. The Palestinian people are legally entitled to reject a further loss of land over which they have an exclusive, legal, peremptory right. Any such rejection makes no difference to Israels immediate legal obligation to end the occupation. /n/nFirst: the occupation must end: Israel must renounce its claim to sovereignty over the Palestinian territory; all settlers must be removed. Immediately. This is required to end the illegality, to discharge the positive obligation to enable immediate Palestinian self-administration, and because Israel lacks any legal entitlement to exercise authority. /n/nSecond, in the absence of the occupation ending, necessarily, everything Israel does in the Palestinian territory lacks a valid international legal basis and is, therefore (subject to the Namibia exception), invalid, not only those things violating the law regulating the conduct of the occupation. Those norms entitle and require Israel to do certain things. But this does not alter the more fundamental position, from the law on the use of force and self-determination, that Israel lacks any valid authority to do anything, and whatever it does is illegal, even if compliant with or pursuant to the conduct-regulatory rules."

      "texto": "Mr President and esteemed Members of the International Court of Justice, it is my great honour to appear before you today on behalf of the Republic of Fiji.\n\nMr President, for many decades Fiji has built a tradition of peacekeeping. Our commitment to world peace is unwavering and we are resolute in our efforts to contribute to global stability. I have personally had the privilege of leading peacekeeping operations in the Middle East over a period of more than 20 years.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, Fiji supports all efforts to establish a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. Efforts that recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the right of the Jewish State of Israel to exist as a sovereign State with secure borders. Efforts that emphasize the need for the parties to engage in constructive negotiations, as envisaged by the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n\nFiji affirms the important role of this Court as the highest judicial organ of the United Nations in resolving disputes between States and assisting United Nations organs in their activities.\n\nIn so doing, the Court must promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. According to Article 1 of the United Nations Charter, one of the main purposes of the United Nations is “to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples”. Fiji strongly believes that the only way to achieve truly sustainable peace between Israel and the Palestinian people  indeed between any neighbours  is through mutual respect.\n\nAs reflected in our Written Statement, Fiji considers it essential to maintain and uphold the legal framework agreed between the parties and sanctioned by the Security Council to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian dispute. That framework is founded on the understanding that Jews and Arabs must coexist in a small piece of territory. This requires direct negotiations between the parties for an agreed outcome.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, the General Assembly has requested the Court to answer certain questions that focus on the legal consequences of the policies and practices of only one party to this dispute.\n\nTo answer these questions, the Court would need to carry out an independent judicial assessment of both the law and the facts, on virtually every aspect of the Israel–Palestine dispute, taking account of the relevant context. This is not an easy task. As Judge Higgins noted in her separate opinion in the Wall Advisory Opinion: “[t]he law, history and politics of the Israel-Palestine dispute is immensely complex”. Further, “[c]ontext is usually important in legal determinations”.\n\nIn Fijis view, this Court has unfortunately been presented in these proceedings with a distinctly one-sided narrative. This fails to take account of the complexity of this dispute and misrepresents the legal, historical and political context.\n\nIn its Written Statement, Fiji has provided several reasons why the Court should exercise its judicial discretion not to render an advisory opinion on the questions that have been posed by the General Assembly:\nfirst, the request is a legal manoeuvre to circumvent the existing internationally sanctioned and legally binding framework for resolution of the Israel-Palestine dispute;\nsecond, to give an opinion in this case “would have the effect of circumventing the principle that a State is not obliged to allow its disputes to be submitted to judicial settlement without its consent”; and  third, due to the one-sided formulation of the questions posed in resolution 77/247, the Court does not have before it the accurate and reliable information that it would need to render an opinion on the questions posed.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, in this oral presentation I will address the first and third of these issues.\n\nI turn to the existing framework.\n\nIn these proceedings, the Court has been asked to render an advisory opinion that may well mean, in effect, the “immediate”, “unconditional” and “total” end to the occupation  that is, withdrawal of all Israeli military and civilians from the entirety of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. This withdrawal must not only be complete, but it must also be unconditional  in other words, Israel may not impose or require any limitations or conditions. This unconditionality is supposedly necessary in order that the Palestinian people have a sovereign State on such territory, which they assert is the only way to achieve justice and therefore peace.\n\nFiji respectfully submits that this demand of a complete and unconditional withdrawal circumvents the peace process and the agreements that have been made in pursuit of that process.\n\nMr President, the fact is that, from 1993, Israel and Palestine entered into the series of agreements known collectively as the “Oslo Accords”. The parties expressed the intention to “put an end to decades of confrontation and to live in peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity and security, while recognizing their mutual legitimate and political rights”. To that end, they agreed on a wide range of interim measures, pending the achievement of a final agreement through permanent status negotiations.\n\nSome of those interim measures include:\n\nThe Palestinian Authority was established.\n\nPowers and responsibilities were transferred from the Israeli military government and its civil administration to the Palestinian Authority, while Israel continued to exercise powers and responsibilities not so transferred.\n\nDirect, free and general political elections were to be held by the Palestinians.\n\nThe West Bank was divided into three areas: A, B and C. The Palestinians would obtain exclusive control over Area A; Area B would be under joint Israeli/Palestinian control; and Area C would be under exclusive Israeli control.\n\nLastly, the parties would enter negotiations on the permanent status to resolve the remaining issues, which included “settlements”, “borders”, “Jerusalem” and “security”.\n\nIn addition, the Oslo Accords contain a specific dispute resolution mechanism, and do not permit either party unilaterally to commence or ask others to commence external legal proceedings.\n\nSince 1993, an extensive set of arrangements has been put in place to operationalize the agreements.\n\nIn 2003, the General Assembly endorsed the Oslo Accords and the Security Council has “[e]ndorsed the Quartet Performance-based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict”. This Court itself confirmed the importance of the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap in the Wall Advisory Opinion in 2004.\n\nAccording to the Roadmap,\n“a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only be achieved through an end to violence and terrorism, when the Palestinian people have a leadership acting decisively against terror and willing and able to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty, and through Israels readiness to do what is necessary for a democratic Palestinian state to be established, and a clear, unambiguous acceptance by both parties of the goal of a negotiated settlement”.\n\nThe thrust of the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap is mutual performance and good faith negotiation, leading to a consensual outcome.\n\nThe Oslo Accords are legally binding. Remarkably, the Palestinians do not refer to these agreements in their Written Statement, while less than 12 months ago both Israel and Palestine reaffirmed their “unwavering commitment to all previous agreements between them” and “to address all outstanding issues through direct dialogue”.\n\nMr President, it is our submission that the request to this Court to opine on questions that address the legal obligations of only one party to this dispute conflicts with the clear rights and obligations of both parties in the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap, and which exclude recourse to this Court.\n\nFor this reason, Fiji respectfully submits that the Court should exercise its discretion not to render an opinion on those questions.\n\nMr President, Members of this honourable Court, I now turn to the issue of legal and factual evidence.\n\nAs stated, in Fijis view, the Court should decline to answer the questions posed. But were it to do so, it would need to gather and independently assess the probative value of evidence on issues raised within the established legal framework of the dispute.\n\nThis Court would have to decide, as it has previously explained,\n“whether [it] has before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon any disputed questions of fact the determination of which is necessary for it to give an opinion in conditions compatible with its judicial character”.\n\nIn Fijis view the Court cannot simply defer to the reports of United Nations bodies. In order to fulfil its judicial function, the Court must reach its own independent findings of fact.\n\nFurther, Fiji submits that, due to the selective and one-sided formulations of the questions, the Court does not have before it all the evidence it would need to exercise its judicial function.\n\nMr President and esteemed Members of the Court, the point here is that the Court is being asked to focus solely on the policies and practices of one of the parties to this dispute, to the exclusion of the policies and practices of the other. This is highly problematic. If the Court would limit itself to consideration of the questions asked, it would be unable to consider the relevant broader context, and it will also not have before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion upon questions of fact that are in dispute, all of which would be necessary to give an opinion compatible with its judicial character.\n\nWe will illustrate this by looking briefly at three of the issues raised by the questions that have been posed to the Court, and these are: withdrawal and security, territorial sovereignty, and the right to self-determination."

      "texto": "Mr President and Members of the Court, the General Assemblys request speaks of Israels “prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967”. This asks the Court to presuppose that all the territories held during the Jordanian and Egyptian occupation within the 1949 Armistice Lines are “Palestinian” that is, that they are sovereign territories of Palestine and thus not of Israel.\n\nA precise definition of the scope of territorial claims is important because “[t]erritorial sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the international political and legal order. It ‘serves to divide between nations the space upon which human activities are employed, in order to assure them at all points the minimum of protection of which international law is the guardian.”\n\nIn the context of the questions put to this Court, territorial sovereignty is critical because without clarifying the respective claims of Israel and the Palestinians concerning the sovereign status of the territory, it would be impossible to answer the questions of territorial scope of the Palestinian self-determination claim or the occupation.\n\nFiji notes that the question of territorial scope both of the State of Israel and of the self-determination claim of the Palestinian people is in dispute between the parties.\n\nAnd yet the way the questions are drafted excludes the possibility of the Court considering Israels claims to the sovereignty over the territory and asks the Court to assume without further investigation that these territories are somehow “Palestinian”.\n\nFurthermore, the Court would need to assess whether the Palestinians have sovereignty and, if so, over which territory. This would include an examination, among other things, of the history of Palestinian assertions of claims and of whether Palestinians make different assertions of sovereignty in different fora.\n\nPalestine asserts that the provisions in the Mandate for Palestine concerning the establishment of a Jewish homeland as envisaged in the Balfour Declaration were illegitimate and in contravention of the Covenant of the League of Nations. It appears to claim that all the territory of Mandate Palestine  even including what is generally accepted to be the territory of the State of Israel belongs to the Palestinian people.\n\nMr President, Israel asserts, and Fiji agrees, that the Mandate for Palestine, including its provisions concerning the establishment of the Jewish homeland, such as the right of the Jewish people to live in and closely settle the land, was a binding instrument of international law. Israel also argues that the relevance of the rights conferred by the Mandate for Palestine was affirmed in Article 80 of the United Nations Charter, the so-called “Palestinian clause”.\n\nThere is thus a dispute about territorial sovereignty. Fiji submits that this dispute cannot and should not be resolved through means of the requested advisory opinion, for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that the question of “borders” and therefore the scope of territorial sovereignty was expressly agreed to be resolved through the permanent status negotiations to which the parties have committed themselves in the Oslo Accords. For the reasons set out earlier, this precludes the matter being adjudicated via an advisory opinion procedure.\n\nThe second reason is that, in any event, because of the way the questions to the Court have been formulated, the Court simply does not have before it sufficient information and evidence to enable it to arrive at a judicial conclusion on the disputed issue of the geographic limits of the territorial sovereignty of Palestine and Israel.\n\nI now turn to self-determination.\n\nThe questions before the Court ask it to assume that Israel is violating “the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination”.\n\nThe question of self-determination raises the question of territorial scope. This raises the evidentiary concerns I have just expressed.\n\nMoreover, Fiji notes that the right to self-determination is a relative right. It should not involve changes to existing frontiers. In the context of Israel/Palestine, this means that the Court would need to ascertain whether the Palestinians exercise of their right to self-determination has infringed the territorial integrity, political inviolability or legitimate security needs of the State of Israel.\n\nBy asking the Court to look only at the policies and practices of Israel, resolution 77/247 shields from the Courts purview the policies and practices of Palestine. The result, in Fijis submission, is that the Court simply does not have before it sufficient information concerning the policies and practices of Palestine, and thus is unable to make a judicial determination on whether, in exercise of their right to self-determination, Palestine has infringed the sovereignty of the State of Israel."

      "texto": "First, withdrawal and security. Palestine argues that the occupation is illegal and the legal consequence is that Israel must withdraw from the occupied territories. As highlighted earlier, any assessment of the questions posed would require the Court to consider the legal rights and obligations of both parties under the Oslo Accords.\n\nThe Oslo Accords were built upon Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, which were adopted following the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli Wars. They recognize the legitimate security needs of Israel to prevent further attack.\n\nResolutions 242 and 338, and thus the Oslo Accords, do not oblige Israel to withdraw from all the territories.\n\nFurther, resolutions 242 and 338 refer to peace being established by the application of two mutually dependent principles: “(i) Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict; and (ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.”\n\nBy incorporating these resolutions into the Oslo Accords, the parties recognize that Israels withdrawal and the creation of conditions providing security to Israel are interdependent. As Judge Higgins stated in the Wall Opinion, both “Israel and Palestine [need] to move in parallel to secure the necessary conditions for Israel to withdraw from Arab occupied territory and for Palestine to provide the conditions to allow Israel to feel secure in so doing”.\n\nIn other words, if the Court is to consider the legal consequences of the alleged Israeli refusal to withdraw from territory, it should also look at what Palestine must do to ensure Israels security.\n\nMr President and Members of this honourable Court, the events of 7 October 2023 have shown us what could happen if there were a complete and unconditional withdrawal without the necessary arrangements in place to guarantee the security of Israel and its population. At the very least, the Court would need to examine and evaluate evidence concerning the question whether the in turn would require examination of the threats facing Israel emanating from the occupied territories and the broader region."

      "pregunta": "The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
      "texto": "Mr President, Members of the Court, representing the final State appearing, I have the honour of identifying the main points addressed during the course of this hearing on the violations by Israel of international law.\n\nThe Maldives provides this analysis with a focus on the issue of water resources. Why? Because of two streams of significance.\n\nFirst, the significance of water resources to the Palestinian people: in fact, it has been described as the “most vital resource in the [Occupied Palestinian Territory]” by Palestine. A tidal wave of suffering has been unleashed by Israeli policies and practices with respect to water resources, which are characterized by deprivation, denial, discrimination and destruction:\n\nDeprivation of access to water many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip simply have, I use the Courts own words, “no access to potable water”.\n\nDenial of enjoyment of those resources on a discriminatory basis—in the West Bank, where Israel has seized control of water resources, use of vital groundwaters is marred by grossly inequitable allocations between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nDestruction of vital infrastructure, with Israel demolishing sanitation structures and pipelines. The second stream of significance is to the questions before the Court. The issue of water resources flows through four key aspects of the unlawfulness of Israeli policies and practices on which the Oral Submissions have focused. I address each aspect in turn.\n\nThe first key aspect: the violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The following points are crystal clear.\n\nFirst, the Palestinians are a distinct people with a right to self-determination, an inalienable norm of jus cogens.\n\nSecond, Israels conduct has violated different components of that right, notably the right to territorial integrity, the right not to be subjected to demographic manipulation within that territory by a foreign Power, the right of the people to pursue its chosen economic, social and cultural development and its right to exercise permanent sovereignty over its natural resources.\n\nThe critical importance of this well-established latter component the Palestinian peoples right to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources was recently stressed by the General Assembly in its resolution of December 2023. Such resources clearly include water. Israels policies and practices with respect to water resources the deprivation, denial on a discriminatory basis and destruction thus constitute one acutely serious and ongoing facet of the breach of the Palestinian peoples right of self-determination. Described by a United Nations body as “one of the most fundamental conditions for survival”, for a people sufficient clean water is indispensable.\n\nTurning to the second key aspect, the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force.\n\nThis afternoon, we have heard some attempts to muddy the waters in this regard, so I will recall the points of crystal clarity.\n\nFirst, a corollary of the jus cogens prohibition of use of force is the prohibition of any acquisition of territory by threat or use of force. Irrespective of international recognition of Palestines borders, the applicability of this prohibition to the Occupied Palestinian Territory cannot be in doubt, as expressly recognized in resolutions of both the General Assembly and Security Council.\n\nSecond, international law requires that occupation be temporary.\n\nThird, any purported exercise of the use of self-defence must be necessary and proportionate.\n\nFourth, and flowing from the three previous points, an occupying Power cannot acquire sovereignty over an occupied territory, including by annexation, irrespective of whether it claims to have acted in self-defence at any point during the occupation.\n\nYet Israel has annexed all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, whether through Israeli law or conduct manifesting a de facto annexation, creating a “fait accompli”. There is no shortage of evidence on this reality, as emphasized by many United Nations bodies and demonstrated by the map recently shown by the Prime Minister of Israel before the General Assembly referred to on the first day of this hearing.\n\nIsraels deprivation, denial on a discriminatory basis and destruction with respect to water resources is one facet of this annexation. The scale and nature of Israels conduct in this regard makes clear that it forms an integral element of Israels establishment of control through coercive measures reflecting its intention to appropriate that territory permanently, the occupation having (to quote the Special Rapporteur) “burst through the restraints of temporariness long ago”.\n\nIsraels settlement expansion is plainly another integral element of that annexation, with Palestinians reduced to inhabiting a “fragmented archipelago of disparate patches of land”.\n\nOf course, the different aspects of Israels violations of international law are not watertight from one another. Such prolonged occupation, annexation and settlement expansion also violate the right of self-determination, to which I referred earlier, a right which cannot be exercised in the face of a foreign occupier purporting to appropriate territory for itself and thereby dispossess the Palestinian people.\n\nThe third key aspect is that the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate the law of occupation.\n\nThe indisputable starting-point is that, as an occupying power, Israel is bound to respect, throughout the occupied territory, its obligations under international humanitarian law, a régime designed to ensure the protection of the people under occupation.\n\nThe Maldives agrees that the continuing applicability of international humanitarian law is without prejudice to the unlawfulness of Israels occupation.\n\nNow, many examples of international humanitarian law breaches have been cited before the Court, including with respect to Israels settlement policy as a breach of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israels policies and practices with respect to water resources constitute a cascade of further violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 1907 Hague Regulations, notably:\n\nIsraels conduct is a violation of the rules prohibiting destruction of property, which includes water and sanitation infrastructure, in circumstances where it is clearly not “absolutely necessary” for military operations.\n\nIt is a violation of the prohibition on destruction or removal of objects essential for survival of the civilian population, with water installations and supplies obviously qualifying as such.\n\nIt is a violation of the prohibition on pillage, as well as the rules of usufruct.\n\nIt is also a violation of the obligation to ensure and maintain public health and hygiene in territory it occupies. This goes to a point of grave practical concern a raft of horrific diseases spring directly from the lack of clean water, with little children particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe fourth and final key aspect is that Israels policies and practices in the Occupied Territory are in violation of international human rights law, including the fundamental jus cogens prohibition of discrimination.\n\nThe irrefutable starting-point: this is that Israel bears a duty to secure respect for the applicable rules of international human rights law throughout the territory that it occupies.\n\nInternational human rights law encompasses the right to water. Notably:\n\nThat right emanates from Articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. As the General Assembly affirmed in 2016, “the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living are essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights”.\n\nFurther, as a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Israel has expressly undertaken to pursue “full implementation” of each childs rights to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including through the provision of clean drinking water.\n\nEqually clearly, international human rights law prohibits discrimination. Notably, pursuant to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Israel is obliged to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, national or ethnic origin, to the enjoyment of rights, which include a right to water.\n\nYet Israels discriminatory policies and practices with respect to access to water have been well documented and condemned by a deluge of United Nations bodies, with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination “appalled at the hermetic character of the separation of the two groups [Jewish communities in illegal settlements on the one hand and Palestinian populations on the other hand] who do not enjoy equal access to water resources”.\n\nThe impact on women and children is notably egregious, with the dearth of clean water an acute crisis for mothers trying to feed their babies.\n\nIsraels policy and practices relating to water are but one among many examples of systematic discrimination which have been detailed by other States in these proceedings.\n\nThe Maldives joins the plethora of other States in confirming before this Court that the régime which Israel has established throughout the occupied territory constitutes apartheid, pursuant to the customary international law definition as reflected in Article II of the Apartheid Convention.\n\nMr President, Members of the Court, at a human level, Israels policies and practices with regard to water resources are inexcusably intensifying the hardship being endured by the Palestinian people and exemplify the illegality which has characterized Israels occupation. The final speech for the Maldives will address how the Court should answer the questions posed by the General Assembly in light of Israels breaches of international law."

      "texto": "Question asks the Court to opine on the legal consequences of Israels ongoing violation of the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination, its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and its discriminatory legislation and measures.\n\nThe States appearing before you have been largely consistent on this question. And that is unsurprising because the relevant principles are well established in the customary international law rules on State responsibility and the Courts jurisprudence.\n\nFirst, Israel is obliged to cease its continuing unlawful acts. This includes, of course, an obligation to terminate its occupation, just as South Africa was obliged to withdraw from Namibia where its presence was illegal. The Court there specifically stated that withdrawal must occur “immediately”. Here, the General Assembly has recently stressed “the urgency of achieving without delay an end to the Israeli occupation”.\n\nBut that is not all. Israel must also cease the discrete unlawful practices which have characterized its occupation. For example, it must dismantle the discriminatory régime concerning water resources referred to in Ms Sanders speech, in precisely the same way as the Court previously stated that Israel must dismantle both the wall and the associated legislative and regulatory régime which entrenched discrimination77.\n\nSecondly, at the same time as terminating its unlawful acts, Israel must provide assurances that it will not repeat them."

      "texto": "In question, the General Assembly asked the Court how Israels policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory affect the legal status of the occupation, and what legal consequences arise for all States and the United Nations.\n\nMs Sander has addressed the many illegal aspects of Israels occupation. Each and every one of Israels unlawful acts engages its responsibility as a State. But what is it that determines the status of the occupation? The factors affecting status are those that go beyond illegality in the conduct of the arbitration and that make the occupation irremediable, meaning that the occupation is what the Court described in the Namibia Opinion as “a situation which is maintained in violation of international law”. In other words, it is those breaches of international law that cannot be cured within the occupation, but only by the occupation coming to an end, that render it unlawful as a matter of status.\n\nOne such matter is the permanence of Israels occupation — notably the fait accompli that this Court warned about in its Wall Opinion. Israel has sought to “create irreversible facts on the ground”. As Ms Sander has highlighted, by installing itself as an interminable presence, Israel has violated the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force. The Court need not decide whether Israels occupation was unlawful ab initio; its wrongfulness can be established even if one looks only at the fact of its prolonged continuation with no end in contemplation. The wrongful permanence of Israels presence — that breach of a peremptory norm of international law — cannot be corrected for as long as Israel remains in the occupied territory at all. That is why it goes to the occupations status.\n\nThe same is true when it comes to Israels breaches of the right to self-determination. For example, that right encompasses an entitlement to territorial integrity. Whether or not the territory is within internationally recognized borders, contrary to what you have been told this afternoon. It is inherent in Israels ongoing occupation that it dispossesses Palestinians of their territory and that it divides the territory: recall the “fragmented archipelago” that Ms Sander referred to. Israels presence and the Palestinian peoples right to territorial integrity are mutually exclusive. And again, this is determinative of the occupations status.\n\nWhat are the legal consequences of this analysis? For Israel, they include those I have already addressed in relation to question, starting with a duty immediately to terminate the occupation in its entirety. Given the occupations unlawful status, Israel simply cannot achieve compliance with international law as long as it remains in occupation. As well, Israels ongoing presence cannot produce any effects as a matter of international law, and in particular cannot change the status of any occupied territory.\n\nHowever, as Ms Sander has alluded to, it is not a consequence of the occupations status that Israel can somehow escape obligations concerning the conduct of an occupation. To the contrary, pending its urgent withdrawal, Israel remains bound by rules of international humanitarian law. Those rules apply whenever an occupation exists in fact, lawful or not — and, as the Court has stated, “regardless of the status of the occupied territories”. The same is true of Israels obligations under international human rights law. Those duties are engaged based on Israels exercise of jurisdiction — again, a purely factual state of affairs.\n\nThe conduct of third States and the United Nations is likely to be of critical practical importance in leading Israel to end its unlawful actions. The people of Palestine, like the people of Namibia half a century ago, should be able to “look to the international community for assistance” in realising their rights.\n\nIn light of Israels gross and systematic breaches of jus cogens norms, third States bear certain negative duties articulated in the Courts previous advisory opinions. They must not recognize the situation created by Israels occupation as lawful or lend that occupation any support or assistance. Accordingly, they must avoid acts which could imply such recognition, such as engaging in trade or any “other forms of relationship” with Israel which may “entrench” its position. They also must not enter into or maintain treaty relations in which Israel purports to act on behalf of or concerning that territory, except treaties of a humanitarian character. Third States must not send diplomatic or special missions to Israel with a remit extending to the occupied territory, as if that territory were simply part of Israel. A third State which does not uphold these duties may encounter consequences in its own relations with other States. According to the Court in Namibia, “no State which enters into relations with South Africa concerning Namibia may expect the United Nations or its Members to recognize the validity or effects of such relationship”. The same applies here.\n\nEqually, third States bear certain positive duties: an obligation to co-operate, including through the United Nations, to complete Israels extraction from the occupied territory; a duty to remove any impediments to the Palestinian peoples exercise of the right to self-determination; and a duty to ensure Israels compliance with international humanitarian law.\n\nAs for the United Nations, all of its component parts, but especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should “consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal situation”. In 2004, the Court urged the United Nations, as a matter of “urgent necessity”, to “redouble its efforts to bring the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a speedy conclusion”. That urgency has not abated; it has intensified. How the Court advises the General Assembly on this occasion will, it is to be hoped, help to illuminate the path forward for the entire United Nations system."

      "texto": "Mr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the International Law Commission, in the report of its seventy-third session, has referred to the basic rules of international humanitarian law as having the status of a peremptory norm of general international law (ius cogens), with the legal consequences that that status may entail.\n\nThe provisions of the Hague Regulations, annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, to which Israel is not a party, have become nevertheless part of customary international law. Particularly pertinent in the present case is Section III of those Regulations, which concerns “Military authority over the territory of the hostile State”. Furthermore, the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party, is applicable in any occupied territory in the event of an armed conflict and, as the Court has assessed, it is applicable to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem.\n\nRegarding Israeli settlements, Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that “[t]he Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. It prohibits also any measure taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfer of parts of its own population into the occupied territory. Since 1977, Israel has conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories which are in contravention of the aforementioned Article 49, paragraph 6. Therefore, the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution, as stated repeatedly by relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The establishment of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories is tending to alter the demographic composition of that territory, contributing to demographic changes, all in contravention of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nThe practice of demolitions results in the forcible transfer or forced eviction of Palestinians and impedes a de facto return of Palestinian families and communities to their original dwellings, all in contravention of international humanitarian law.\n\nFurthermore, in 2004 the Court considered that the construction of the wall and its associated régime create a “fait accompli” on the ground that could well become permanent, in which case it would be tantamount to a de facto annexation, as well as a contribution to further alterations of the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nArticles 47, 49, 52, 53 and 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention remain applicable to the occupied Palestinian territories and are to be taken into account in this case.\nSpain is of the view that neither Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, nor the state of necessity, have any relevance in this case in order to preclude the wrongfulness of those actions."

      "texto": "Mr President, distinguished Members of the Court, both Israel and Palestine are under the obligation to observe the rules of international law.\n\nProhibition of the use of force, illegal territorial acquisition and principle of self-determination\n\nIn the 1967 armed conflict, Israeli forces occupied all the territories that had constituted Palestine under the British Mandate (including those known as the West Bank) located east of the Green Line. This occupation was immediately and unanimously condemned by Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which underlined that “all Member States, in accepting the Charter of the United Nations, have undertaken to act in accordance with Article 2 of the Charter”.\n\nThe principle of prohibition of the use of armed force is one of the fundamental principles of international law and, as formulated in General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), is accompanied by the following corollary: “No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”. The Court, which has on several occasions affirmed the importance of this principle has not hesitated to apply this principle to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. In the Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (2004), the Court has recalled the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. The Court concluded: “Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of an occupying Power”.\n\nFinally, the Court added: “Subsequent events in these territories have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power”. Although Israel finally withdrew its civilian and military presence from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it has maintained full control of its borders, coastline and airspace ever since. Consequently, as the Security Council has affirmed, the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967.\n\nThe Court concluded that Israels settlement policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the measures taken with regard to Jerusalem and the construction of the wall have been established in violation of international law, not only because they are contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention, but also because they prevent the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination. In its construction, the Court points out that the wall, the temporary nature of which is open to doubt, is accompanied by a regulatory régime aimed at annexing the occupied territories. This aim constitutes a serious violation of the rules of international humanitarian law incumbent upon Israel as the occupying Power, has the effect of violating the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, and the human rights of the inhabitants of these territories. These statements are also applicable to the Gaza Strip. Israels withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 has not meant that the occupation of the territory came to an end, as Israel has retained effective control over the territory through its control of airspace, territorial sea and external land boundaries.\n\nThe extensive documentation submitted to this advisory procedure demonstrates that, 20 years after the Courts Opinion, Israel continues to implement its policies, prolonging the very serious violations of international law found by the Court.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, on 3 October 1991, Israel ratified both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. As stated by the Court, the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict.\n\nRegarding the territorial scope of those instruments, they are applicable in respect of acts executed by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory, that is, that they apply both to territories over which a State party has sovereignty and to those over which that State exercises territorial jurisdiction.\n\nThose elements concur in this case; therefore, Spain considers that those instruments are applicable within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nAs stated by the Court in its Advisory Opinion of 2004, the territories occupied by Israel have been now, for over 50 years, subject to its territorial jurisdiction as the occupying Power. In the exercise of the powers available to it on this basis, Israel is bound by the provisions of human rights law and, furthermore, it is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.\n\nHaving determined the applicability of human rights law within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, it is time to seek whether Israeli policies and practices referred to in paragraph 18 of General Assembly resolution 77/247 have violated those rules and, therefore, have infringed the human rights of Palestinians living in the territory occupied by Israel. Among those rights that are being violated are those of Articles 17 and 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nAlso, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 has underlined in her latest report to the Human Rights Council that Israeli forces often detain individuals without charge or trial, in what has been denominated “administrative detention”. Administrative detention is permissible only under very strict circumstances and must always be carried out in line with the protection afforded under international law.\n\nPalestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories are subject to a system of jurisdictional fragmentation in the context of a structure of institutionalized discrimination. Israeli military courts enforce military law upon Palestinians, while Israeli courts apply Israeli civil law to Israelis, including settlers.\n\nRegarding the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, there are several provisions affected by Israels policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories, for example: the right to work (Articles 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young persons (Article 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and the right “to be free from hunger” (Article 11); the right to health (Article 12) and the right to education (Articles 13 and 14). Similar provisions can be found in Articles 14, 16, 27 and 28 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nState parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, according to its Article 2, shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in it to each child within their jurisdiction. Of particular concern are the detention, interrogation, prosecution and imprisonment of numerous Palestinian children by Israeli occupation forces, practice that is contrary to Article 37 of that Convention.\n\nCertain policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories impose restrictions on the freedom of movement of the inhabitants of the occupied Palestinian territories, and deprive a significant number of Palestinians of their freedom to choose their residence and have, as well, repercussions for agricultural production, through the confiscation and destruction of agricultural assets. On the other hand, the population of the occupied Palestinian territories is experiencing increasing difficulties regarding access to health services, educational facilities and sources of water, impeding the exercise by the persons concerned of the right to health, to education, to water, to sanitation and to an adequate standard of living. All these difficulties and restrictions infringe a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the territory occupied by Israel which cannot be justified neither by military exigencies, nor by the requirements of national security or public order.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, what are the legal consequences arising from the repeated, permanent and aggravated non-compliance of core rules of international law? This is the question the General Assembly requested to the Court. When this question is examined from the perspective of the law of State responsibility, the importance of the advisory opinion becomes critical.\n\nArticles 40 and 41 of the 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts answer this question.\nAccording to these Articles, a serious breach of an obligation established for the protection of the interests of the international community as a whole entails the legal consequences stipulated for all breaches of international law and some particular consequences.\nTherefore, the responsible State is obliged to cease the wrongful act, to give, if appropriate, guarantees and assurances of non-repetition, and to make reparation.\nMoreover, the responsible State is bound to continue performance of the international obligation.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to comply with international obligations gives also rise to the right for the injured State to seek redress or take countermeasures.\nHowever, it has been said, Article 41 states that, besides these “ordinary” consequences, serious breaches of ius cogens rules gives rise to some additional particular consequences, which, generally speaking, imply certain obligations for all other States to respond to the wrongful act: namely obligation to co-operate with and bring to an end the alleged violation, obligation not to recognize the illegal situation and obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation.\n\nMr President, my intervention will focus on these particular obligations of all States (other than the injured State). In its 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Wall, the Court briefly referred to these additional consequences.\n\nTwenty years later, with the worsening of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court is called upon to set out in greater detail these obligations.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the duty to co-operate to bring to an end remains the first obligation of States, according to Article 41 of the Draft Articles. This obligation to co-operate shall be carried out by all States.\nIn the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, co-operation among all States has been organized in the framework of the United Nations.\nOnce again, 20 years after the Advisory Opinion on the Wall was passed, it is an indisputable reality that the situation in Palestine has worsened; and that resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have repeatedly condemned the actions of the parties and repeatedly demanded the cessation of the violations of international law. However, such resolutions have failed to establish redress and sanction measures.\n\nTherefore, the reference of Article 41 to the action of all States becomes critical. In some way paragraph 159 of the Advisory Opinion on the Wall underlines this when this paragraph establishes that “it is also for all States” to take measures to end the breach. Moreover, in the comments to Conclusion 19 of the Draft conclusions on identification and legal consequences of peremptory norms of general international law (ius cogens), we can read that this statement suggests “that, over and above collective action, there is an obligation on individual States to make efforts to bring situations created by the breach to an end”.\n\nIn the current circumstances, maybe the Court could determine what such an obligation to co-operate might consist of in this case.\nIn doing so, the Court may take into consideration the numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, especially those resolutions stating that States are obliged not to take measures that would imply changes in the status of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The corollary is clear: “establishing diplomatic missions in the Holy City” is a serious threat to the stability of peace in the region and the world.\n\nComing back to the co-operation of all States within the bodies of the United Nations, the Court could determine whether the obligation of all States to co-operate to bring to an end any serious violations of peremptory norms entails, within the Security Council in particular, the duty to not prevent, hinder or delay collective action in favour of the peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n6. Mr President, let me move on now to consider the two particular duties included in Article 41, paragraph 2, of the 2001 Draft Articles: namely the duty not to recognize the illegal situation and the duty not to render aid or assistance in maintaining this situation.\n\nWhat situation?\n\nThe last resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict update the scope of the current situation that should not be legally recognized.\nCertainly, resolution 74/88 of the General Assembly, the first one including this formula, “[c]alls upon all States... not to recognize, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining, the situation created by measures that are illegal under international law, including those aimed at advancing annexation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.\nSince these two obligations have been reiterated by the Court and other United Nations bodies in this, but also in other situations, they are to be considered as customary law (something that by the way the International Law Commission has already affirmed).\n\nFinally, let me, Mr President, refer briefly to paragraph 3 of Article 41 of the Draft Articles, which states that international law may recognize additional legal consequences deriving from the legal régime to which the primary rule that has been violated belongs.\nThese particular obligations can be found either in the foundation of the legal régime particular or in Security Council resolutions.\n\nArticles 47 and 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention are good examples of obligations provided for in the foundational treaties of a concrete, a particular legal régime, like international humanitarian law. While Article 47 establishes the inviolability of the rights of persons in occupied territories, Article 146 refers to the obligation of the States parties to the Convention to prosecute and condemn persons who commit or order to be committed any of the grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThat said, these obligations linked to a particular legal régime sometimes are specified by the Security Council itself. This is the case of resolution 2334 (2016) which requires a State to distinguish in their relevant dealings between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, Spain formulates these considerations within the framework of a consultative procedure, aware that the Court  guardian of international legality can offer the United Nations arguments to adopt decisions to address the situation and, at the same time, contribute to the clarification and development of the international legal order."

Certainly, resolution 74/88 of the General Assembly, the first one including this formula, “[c]alls upon all States... not to recognize, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining, the situation created by measures that are illegal under international law, including those aimed at advancing annexation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”. Since these two obligations have been reiterated by the Court and other United Nations bodies in this, but also in other situations, they are to be considered as customary law (something that by the way the International Law Commission has already affirmed).\n\nFinally, let me, Mr President, refer briefly to paragraph 3 of Article 41 of the Draft Articles, which states that international law may recognize additional legal consequences deriving from the legal régime to which the primary rule that has been violated belongs. These particular obligations can be found either in the foundation of the legal régime particular or in Security Council resolutions.\n\nArticles 47 and 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention are good examples of obligations provided for in the foundational treaties of a concrete, a particular legal régime, like international humanitarian law.

In its 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Wall, the Court briefly referred to these additional consequences.\n\nTwenty years later, with the worsening of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Court is called upon to set out in greater detail these obligations.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, the duty to co-operate to bring to an end remains the first obligation of States, according to Article 41 of the Draft Articles. This obligation to co-operate shall be carried out by all States. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, co-operation among all States has been organized in the framework of the United Nations. Once again, 20 years after the Advisory Opinion on the Wall was passed, it is an indisputable reality that the situation in Palestine has worsened; and that resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have repeatedly condemned the actions of the parties and repeatedly demanded the cessation of the violations of international law. However, such resolutions have failed to establish redress and sanction measures.\n\nTherefore, the reference of Article 41 to the action of all States becomes critical. In some way paragraph 159 of the Advisory Opinion on the Wall underlines this when this paragraph establishes that “it is also for all States” to take measures to end the breach. Moreover, in the comments to Conclusion 19 of the Draft conclusions on identification and legal consequences of peremptory norms of general international law (ius cogens), we can read that this statement suggests “that, over and above collective action, there is an obligation on individual States to make efforts to bring situations created by the breach to an end”.\n\nIn the current circumstances, maybe the Court could determine what such an obligation to co-operate might consist of in this case. In doing so, the Court may take into consideration the numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, especially those resolutions stating that States are obliged not to take measures that would imply changes in the status of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The corollary is clear: “establishing diplomatic missions in the Holy City” is a serious threat to the stability of peace in the region and the world.\n\nComing back to the co-operation of all States within the bodies of the United Nations, the Court could determine whether the obligation of all States to co-operate to bring to an end any serious violations of peremptory norms entails, within the Security Council in particular, the duty to not prevent, hinder or delay collective action in favour of the peaceful resolution of the conflict. 6. Mr President, let me move on now to consider the two particular duties included in Article 41, paragraph 2, of the 2001 Draft Articles: namely the duty not to recognize the illegal situation and the duty not to render aid or assistance in maintaining this situation.\n\nWhat situation?\n\nThe last resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict update the scope of the current situation that should not be legally recognized. Certainly, resolution 74/88 of the General Assembly, the first one including this formula, “[c]alls upon all States... not to recognize, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining, the situation created by measures that are illegal under international law, including those aimed at advancing annexation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”. Since these two obligations have been reiterated by the Court and other United Nations bodies in this, but also in other situations, they are to be considered as customary law (something that by the way the International Law Commission has already affirmed).\n\nFinally, let me, Mr President, refer briefly to paragraph 3 of Article 41 of the Draft Articles, which states that international law may recognize additional legal consequences deriving from the legal régime to which the primary rule that has been violated belongs. These particular obligations can be found either in the foundation of the legal régime particular or in Security Council resolutions.\n\nArticles 47 and 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention are good examples of obligations provided for in the foundational treaties of a concrete, a particular legal régime, like international humanitarian law. While Article 47 establishes the inviolability of the rights of persons in occupied territories, Article 146 refers to the obligation of the States parties to the Convention to prosecute and condemn persons who commit or order to be committed any of the grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThat said, these obligations linked to a particular legal régime sometimes are specified by the Security Council itself. This is the case of resolution 2334 (2016) which requires a State to distinguish in their relevant dealings between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.\n\nMr President, distinguished Members of the Court, Spain formulates these considerations within the framework of a consultative procedure, aware that the Court  guardian of international legality can offer the United Nations arguments to adopt decisions to address the situation and, at the same time, contribute to the clarification and development of the international legal order."

    "texto": "\n\n1.Lack of Competence Due to Article 12 of the UN Charter:\n\nArticle 12, paragraph 1, of the UN Charter states that while the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.\n\nThe Security Council was actively engaged with the situation in the Middle East, specifically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Given this engagement, the General Assembly's request for an advisory opinion might be seen as a recommendation concerning a matter under the Security Council's purview, which contravenes Article 12.
    \n\n2. Involvement in Domestic Affairs: The construction of the wall involves intricate issues of domestic policy and security, particularly for Israel. The ICJs involvement in what could be construed as a domestic affair might infringe on national sovereignty and set a precedent for international interference in internal matters. This could lead to a broader erosion of state sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs, which are fundamental tenets of international law.
    \n\n3. Risk of Escalating Tensions: An advisory opinion from the ICJ, regardless of its content, might inflame tensions in an already volatile region. Parties on either side of the conflict may use the opinion to justify further actions, potentially escalating violence and undermining peace efforts. The potential for misinterpretation or selective application of the opinion by different stakeholders could exacerbate distrust and hostility, further complicating efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
    \n\n4. Lack of Binding Force: Advisory opinions of the ICJ are not legally binding. The non-binding nature of the opinion could render it ineffective in compelling compliance, particularly from parties deeply entrenched in their positions. This could lead to a situation where the ICJs advisory opinions are ignored, diminishing the Courts perceived authority and weakening the international legal framework as a whole. Without enforceability, the advisory opinion risks being disregarded by the parties involved, thereby undermining its significance and impact on the resolution of the conflict.
    \n\n5. Precedent of Judicial Activism: Issuing an advisory opinion in this context might be seen as judicial activism, where the ICJ is perceived as stepping beyond its traditional role to influence political outcomes. This activism could provoke criticism and reduce the Courts legitimacy. By wading into such a politically charged issue, the ICJ risks being perceived as biased or partial, undermining its reputation as an impartial arbiter of international law. This could lead to a loss of trust in the Court's judgments and weaken the credibility of international legal institutions."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Ultra Vires Action by the General Assembly:\n\nIt can be argued that the General Assembly exceeded its authority (acted ultra vires) by requesting an advisory opinion on a matter actively handled by the Security Council. This overreach challenges the balance of power and responsibilities outlined in the UN Charter, specifically Articles 12 and 24, which assign primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security to the Security Council.
    \n\n2. Potential for Misuse by Political Entities: The advisory opinion might be used by political entities to further their own agendas, rather than to promote justice or peace. This misuse could politicize the ICJs decision and detract from its intended purpose of providing legal clarity. Political actors may selectively interpret or cherry-pick elements of the opinion to serve their interests, leading to further polarization and entrenchment of positions. This could undermine the credibility of the ICJ and international law more broadly, as its judgments are perceived as being driven by political considerations rather than legal principles.
    \n\n3. Undermining the Security Councils Role: The Security Council is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security. By seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ, the General Assembly may be seen as undermining the Security Councils role and authority, leading to inter-organ conflict within the UN. This could weaken the effectiveness of the Security Council in addressing conflicts and crises around the world, as its decisions are circumvented or undermined by other UN bodies. Such discord within the UN system could hinder collective action and diminish the organization's ability to respond to global challenges.
    \n\n4. Complications from Multiple Legal Frameworks: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves multiple legal frameworks, including international law, humanitarian law, and domestic law. The ICJs attempt to navigate these overlapping frameworks could result in an overly complex and potentially contradictory opinion that fails to provide clear guidance. This could create confusion among the parties involved and hinder efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution. Moreover, conflicting legal interpretations could exacerbate tensions and impede progress towards a negotiated settlement, further entrenching the status quo and perpetuating the cycle of violence and conflict.
    \n\n5. Potential for Partiality Perception: Given the highly politicized nature of the conflict, any advisory opinion issued by the ICJ might be perceived as partial or biased, regardless of its legal soundness. This perception could damage the Courts reputation for impartiality and fairness, undermining its credibility as an objective adjudicator of international disputes. The risk of perceived partiality could erode trust in the ICJ among the parties involved and diminish the likelihood of them accepting the Court's opinion as a basis for resolving the conflict. This could further prolong the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and impede efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace.
    \n\n6. Impact on Future Legal Proceedings: An advisory opinion in this case could set a precedent that influences future legal proceedings involving similar conflicts. This precedent might limit the ICJs flexibility and discretion in handling diverse and unique international disputes in the future. Parties to future conflicts may cite the advisory opinion as precedent in their own cases, leading to a narrowing of legal arguments and a lack of innovation in the application of international law. This could hinder the development of international jurisprudence and impede efforts to address emerging challenges in the global legal landscape."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Inconsistency with the Uniting for Peace Resolution (377 A (V)):\n\nThe Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly was convened under the Uniting for Peace resolution, which allows the General Assembly to act in the face of Security Council inaction. However, the Security Council had been actively considering the situation, evidenced by various draft resolutions and debates, even though no conclusive resolution was passed due to vetoes.\n\nThe rolling character of the Tenth Emergency Special Session, where it was convened multiple times over several years, raises procedural concerns. This approach could be seen as a manipulation of procedural norms to bypass the Security Council's authority, undermining the established processes and the intended exceptional nature of the Uniting for Peace resolution.
    \n\n2. Challenges in Enforcing Compliance: The ICJ lacks the enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with its advisory opinions. In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where non-compliance with international resolutions is already an issue, the advisory opinion might be ignored, further eroding the credibility of international law. Without meaningful consequences for non-compliance, the advisory opinion risks being dismissed as toothless by the parties involved, undermining the authority and effectiveness of the ICJ as a judicial institution. This could perpetuate a cycle of impunity and disregard for international legal norms, exacerbating conflict and insecurity in the region.
    \n\n3. Question of Timeliness: The timing of the advisory opinion request might be inappropriate, given the current state of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With ongoing negotiations and efforts at peace, the advisory opinion might disrupt delicate diplomatic processes and hinder progress. Parties to the conflict may view the ICJs involvement as premature or unwarranted, undermining confidence in the Courts ability to contribute constructively to the resolution of the conflict. Moreover, issuing an advisory opinion at a sensitive juncture could escalate tensions and derail efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement, prolonging the suffering of the affected populations and perpetuating instability in the region.
    \n\n4. Complexity of the Issue: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is characterized by deep historical, cultural, and political complexities that defy easy resolution. The construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is just one aspect of this multifaceted conflict. Given the intricate nature of the issues involved, the ICJ may struggle to provide a comprehensive and nuanced advisory opinion that addresses all relevant factors. Attempting to simplify such a complex issue into a legal judgment risks oversimplification and may fail to capture the full scope of the conflict, leading to potential inaccuracies or omissions in the Court's analysis.
    \n\n5. Potential for Polarization: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ has the potential to further polarize stakeholders in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Depending on the content of the opinion, it may be perceived as favoring one party over the other, exacerbating existing divisions and fueling resentment. This polarization could hinder efforts to build trust and foster dialogue between the parties, making it more difficult to reach a negotiated settlement. Additionally, it may increase the likelihood of retaliatory actions or escalations of violence as parties react to perceived injustices or biases in the Court's decision.
    \n\n6. Challenges in Implementation: Even if the ICJ were to issue a comprehensive and impartial advisory opinion, implementing its recommendations on the ground presents significant practical challenges. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is marked by deeply entrenched positions and a lack of mutual trust, making it difficult to secure compliance with external legal judgments. Moreover, the logistical and political obstacles to implementing changes on the ground, such as dismantling portions of the wall, are substantial. Without robust mechanisms for enforcement and international support for implementation, the advisory opinion may have limited impact in bringing about tangible changes in the situation.
    \n\n7. Potential for Unintended Consequences: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ carries the risk of unintended consequences that may exacerbate rather than alleviate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For example, if the opinion is perceived as biased or unfair by one or both parties, it could lead to a breakdown in diplomatic relations or a hardening of positions. Similarly, if the opinion is overly restrictive or prescriptive in its recommendations, it may inadvertently undermine the ability of the parties to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution. Anticipating and mitigating these potential unintended consequences requires careful consideration of the broader geopolitical context and potential reactions from all stakeholders.
    \n\n8. Impact on Humanitarian Situation: The focus on legal proceedings and advisory opinions may divert attention and resources away from addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of the affected populations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The construction of the wall has significant humanitarian implications, including restrictions on freedom of movement, access to essential services, and livelihood opportunities for Palestinians. While legal accountability is important, it should not overshadow the immediate needs of those impacted by the conflict. The ICJ must consider the humanitarian consequences of its actions and prioritize efforts to alleviate the suffering of vulnerable populations in its decision-making process.
    \n\n9. Potential for Legalization of Political Issues: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict risks further politicizing and legalizing what is fundamentally a complex political issue. By framing the conflict in legal terms and deferring to a judicial body for resolution, there is a danger of oversimplifying the root causes of the conflict and sidelining political negotiations. This approach may reinforce the perception that legal mechanisms alone can address deep-seated political grievances, undermining the need for sustained diplomatic efforts and compromise-based solutions. Balancing the legal dimensions of the conflict with its underlying political dynamics is essential to avoid exacerbating tensions and promoting genuine peacebuilding efforts.
    \n\n10. Potential for Undermining Peace Processes: The involvement of the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through an advisory opinion may undermine ongoing peace processes and diplomatic initiatives aimed at resolving the conflict through negotiations. External legal interventions, particularly those perceived as biased or one-sided, have the potential to disrupt delicate negotiations and erode trust between the parties. The pursuit of legal avenues for addressing the conflict may detract attention and resources from diplomatic efforts to build confidence, foster dialogue, and reach mutually acceptable agreements. To avoid undermining existing peace processes, any legal interventions must be carefully coordinated and supportive of broader peacebuilding objectives.
    \n\n11. Risk of Setting Dangerous Precedents: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may set dangerous precedents for the resolution of similar conflicts around the world. If the Court's decision is perceived as legitimizing unilateral actions or disregarding the principles of self-determination and territorial sovereignty, it could embolden other states to pursue similar courses of action in their own disputes. This could contribute to a destabilizing trend of unilateralism and disregard for international norms and agreements, undermining efforts to uphold the rule of law and promote peaceful conflict resolution on a global scale."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Security Councils Continued Responsibility: The adoption of Security Council resolution 1515 (2003), which endorsed the Quartet's Roadmap for peace, indicates the Councils continued engagement and responsibility in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This continued responsibility implies that the General Assemblys request for an advisory opinion might interfere with ongoing Security Council efforts, contravening the intended division of labor between these two UN organs.
    \n\n2. Limited Scope for Addressing Root Causes: While the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is a significant issue, an advisory opinion from the ICJ may have limited scope in addressing the underlying root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflict is multifaceted and deeply rooted in historical grievances, competing claims to land and resources, and complex geopolitical dynamics. Focusing solely on the legality of the wall may overlook broader issues related to statehood, sovereignty, refugee rights, and the status of Jerusalem, among others. Without addressing these fundamental issues comprehensively, any legal opinion risks providing only a partial solution to the conflict and may fail to achieve lasting peace.
    \n\n3. Potential for Exacerbating Regional Tensions: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not isolated but is intertwined with broader regional dynamics and geopolitical interests. An advisory opinion from the ICJ has the potential to exacerbate tensions not only between Israel and Palestine but also among regional actors with vested interests in the conflict. Countries in the Middle East and beyond may view the ICJ's involvement as interference in regional affairs and may respond with diplomatic, economic, or military measures that further destabilize the region. The risk of escalation and the potential for unintended consequences underscore the need for cautious and strategic decision-making regarding the ICJ's role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
    \n\n4. Challenges in Achieving Consensus: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is characterized by deep-seated divisions and a lack of consensus on key issues among the parties involved and the international community. Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ may be seen as an attempt to circumvent the challenges of achieving consensus through diplomatic negotiations and compromise. However, the Court's decision is unlikely to be universally accepted or implemented without broad-based support from all stakeholders. In the absence of consensus, the advisory opinion risks further polarizing the parties and undermining efforts to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the conflict.
    \n\n5. Complex Interplay of Legal Frameworks: The legal aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are intertwined with a complex web of international, regional, and domestic legal frameworks, including international humanitarian law, human rights law, and domestic Israeli and Palestinian law. Navigating these overlapping legal frameworks presents significant challenges for the ICJ in providing a coherent and comprehensive advisory opinion. The Court must carefully consider the interactions between these different legal regimes and ensure that its decision reflects a balanced and principled approach to international law.
    \n\n6. Need for Holistic Approach to Peacebuilding: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a holistic approach that addresses not only legal issues but also political, economic, social, and humanitarian dimensions. While the ICJ can provide valuable legal insights, it cannot single-handedly resolve the underlying grievances and mistrust that fuel the conflict. Efforts to achieve peace and reconciliation must involve a range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, and grassroots movements, and must prioritize dialogue, confidence-building measures, and mutual respect. Relying solely on legal mechanisms to address the conflict risks oversimplifying its complexity and may hinder efforts to build sustainable peace in the long term.
    \n\n7. Potential for Legalization of Historical Injustices: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may inadvertently legitimize historical injustices and violations of international law. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rooted in a long history of dispossession, displacement, and human rights abuses, including the establishment of Israeli settlements and the construction of the separation barrier. By focusing narrowly on the legality of specific actions, the ICJ's decision may fail to address broader issues of accountability, reparations, and justice for victims of past and ongoing violations. This risks perpetuating cycles of impunity and undermining efforts to achieve truth, reconciliation, and meaningful redress for affected communities.
    \n\n8. Risk of Legalization of Unilateral Actions: An advisory opinion from the ICJ on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may inadvertently legitimize unilateral actions taken by states in violation of international law. By providing a legal justification or rationale for such actions, the ICJ's decision could set a dangerous precedent that undermines the principles of collective security, multilateralism, and respect for international law. This risks emboldening states to pursue their interests through unilateral means, disregarding the rights and interests of other states and perpetuating conflicts and instability. To avoid enabling unilateralism, the ICJ must carefully consider the broader implications of its decision and prioritize the principles of justice, equity, and respect for international norms and agreements.
    \n\n9. Need for Contextual Understanding: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a nuanced understanding of the historical, cultural, and political context in which it has evolved. While legal analysis can provide valuable insights, it must be complemented by a contextual understanding of the root causes, grievances, and aspirations of the parties involved. The ICJ must take into account the lived experiences of Palestinians and Israelis, the legacy of colonization and dispossession, and the broader regional dynamics that shape the conflict. Without a deep understanding of these complex realities, any legal opinion risks oversimplifying the issues at stake and may fail to resonate with the affected populations or contribute to lasting peace.
    \n\n10. Importance of Diplomatic Engagement: Diplomatic engagement and dialogue are essential for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and achieving a just and lasting peace. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions can play a role in clarifying legal principles and norms, they cannot substitute for meaningful diplomatic engagement and negotiation between the parties. The ICJ's involvement should complement, rather than replace, diplomatic efforts aimed at building trust, fostering dialogue, and addressing the underlying causes of the conflict. By prioritizing diplomacy and cooperation, stakeholders can work together to find mutually acceptable solutions that promote peace, security, and prosperity for all parties involved."

Holding an emergency special session concurrently with the General Assemblys regular session could be seen as procedurally irregular and strategically timed to influence or undermine the regular processes and deliberations of the UN bodies.
    \n\n2. Potential for Escalation of Conflict: The involvement of the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through an advisory opinion may inadvertently escalate tensions and trigger retaliatory actions from both parties. If one party perceives the Court's decision as biased or unfavorable, it could lead to heightened rhetoric, increased militarization, and a deterioration of the security situation on the ground. Moreover, the issuance of a legal judgment may further entrench the parties in their positions, making it harder to reach a negotiated settlement and increasing the likelihood of violent confrontations. The risk of escalation underscores the need for caution and careful consideration of the potential consequences of the ICJ's involvement.
    \n\n3. Challenge of Enforcing Legal Judgments: Even if the ICJ were to issue a definitive advisory opinion on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, enforcing its judgment poses significant practical challenges. The Court lacks its own enforcement mechanism and relies on states to voluntarily comply with its decisions. However, in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where there is a long history of non-compliance with international law and UN resolutions, securing meaningful enforcement of the Court's judgment is unlikely. Without robust mechanisms for holding non-compliant parties accountable, the ICJ's advisory opinion may remain symbolic rather than effectual in bringing about tangible changes on the ground.
    \n\n4. Potential for Legalization of Occupation: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the legality of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may inadvertently legitimize Israel's ongoing occupation and annexation of Palestinian land. By focusing narrowly on the legality of specific actions such as the construction of the wall, the Court's decision may fail to address the broader context of occupation and the rights of Palestinians under international law. This risks perpetuating the status quo of occupation and settlement expansion and undermines efforts to achieve a just and sustainable resolution to the conflict based on the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity.
    \n\n5. Implications for International Relations: The issuance of an advisory opinion by the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has broader implications for international relations and the rule-based international order. If the Court's decision is perceived as biased or politically motivated, it could undermine trust in international legal institutions and weaken the credibility of international law as a mechanism for resolving conflicts. This could have ripple effects beyond the Israeli-Palestinian context, affecting global efforts to promote peace, security, and human rights. The ICJ must therefore uphold the principles of impartiality, independence, and integrity in its decision-making process to maintain the legitimacy of international law.
    \n\n6. Risk of Legalizing Unilateral Border Changes: An advisory opinion from the ICJ on the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory may set a dangerous precedent by legitimizing unilateral border changes and territorial annexations in violation of international law. If the Court were to endorse Israel's actions or provide legal justification for the construction of the wall, it could encourage other states to pursue similar unilateral measures in their own territorial disputes. This risks undermining the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the peaceful settlement of disputes enshrined in the UN Charter and international law, leading to increased instability and conflict globally.
    \n\n7. Impact on Human Rights and Civil Liberties: The construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has significant implications for human rights and civil liberties, including the rights to freedom of movement, access to education, healthcare, and livelihoods. An advisory opinion from the ICJ must carefully consider the human rights dimensions of the issue and ensure that its decision upholds the principles of dignity, equality, and non-discrimination for all affected populations. Failing to prioritize human rights in its judgment risks legitimizing violations of fundamental rights and eroding the protections afforded by international human rights law.
    \n\n8. Need for Comprehensive Conflict Resolution: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying root causes and grievances of all parties involved. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions can contribute to clarifying legal principles and norms, they are not a substitute for inclusive political dialogue, negotiation, and reconciliation. The ICJ's involvement should be part of a broader peacebuilding strategy that prioritizes dialogue, mutual understanding, and compromise to achieve a just and sustainable resolution to the conflict. By addressing the socio-economic, political, and security dimensions of the conflict holistically, stakeholders can work towards building a future based on peace, justice, and dignity for all."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Precedent of Non-Interference: Historically, both the General Assembly and the Security Council have interpreted Article 12 to mean that the Assembly should not make recommendations on matters actively handled by the Council. Deviating from this precedent could set a problematic standard, encouraging future overreach and undermining the Council's primary role in maintaining international peace and security.
    \n\n2. Impact on International Peace and Security: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has broader implications for international peace and security beyond the immediate region. Instability in the Middle East can have ripple effects on global security, including the risk of terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and disruption of energy supplies. Therefore, the ICJ's involvement in providing an advisory opinion on the conflict is not only relevant to the parties directly involved but also to the international community as a whole. A thorough examination of the legal issues by the ICJ can contribute to a better understanding of the conflict's implications for international peace and security and inform global efforts to prevent conflict escalation and promote stability in the region.
    \n\n3. Risk of Undermining Diplomatic Efforts: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ may undermine ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through negotiation and dialogue. Diplomatic negotiations require all parties to engage in good faith and demonstrate a willingness to compromise and find mutually acceptable solutions. However, resorting to legal mechanisms such as the ICJ may be perceived as a unilateral or confrontational approach that bypasses diplomatic channels. This could erode trust between the parties and hinder prospects for meaningful dialogue and conflict resolution. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the potential impact of the ICJ's involvement on diplomatic efforts and the overall peace process.
    \n\n4. Complexities of Territorial Disputes: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves complex territorial disputes over land, borders, and sovereignty, which cannot be easily resolved through legal rulings alone. Territorial disputes are inherently political and require a nuanced understanding of historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that shape competing claims. While the ICJ can provide legal interpretations, it may not have the capacity to address the underlying political complexities and power dynamics that underpin the conflict. Therefore, any advisory opinion must be considered within the broader context of the conflict and complemented by political negotiations aimed at finding mutually acceptable solutions to territorial disputes.
    \n\n5. Potential for Legal Precedent in Conflict Resolution: The ICJ's advisory opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has the potential to set a legal precedent for the resolution of similar conflicts around the world. As one of the primary judicial organs of the United Nations, the ICJ's decisions carry significant weight and influence in shaping international law and norms. Therefore, the Court's interpretation of legal principles and norms in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could have far-reaching implications for other protracted conflicts facing similar legal challenges. It is essential for the ICJ to consider the broader implications of its advisory opinion and strive to provide guidance that promotes peaceful conflict resolution and upholds the principles of justice and fairness.
    \n\n6. Role of International Legal Institutions: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict raises broader questions about the role and effectiveness of international legal institutions in addressing complex political disputes. While the ICJ serves as a forum for the peaceful settlement of disputes between states, its ability to resolve deeply entrenched conflicts involving non-state actors and asymmetrical power dynamics is limited. Therefore, while seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ may be a step towards seeking legal clarity, it should be accompanied by broader efforts to address the underlying political, social, and economic drivers of the conflict. International legal institutions must adapt to the evolving nature of conflicts and explore innovative approaches to complement traditional legal mechanisms with conflict resolution strategies that prioritize inclusivity, dialogue, and reconciliation."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Potential Bias and Political Influence: The advisory opinion request was heavily influenced by political motivations, particularly from the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement. This political context might compromise the impartiality expected of the ICJ, as the court could be seen as a tool for political maneuvering rather than an impartial judicial body providing legal clarity. In summary, these arguments challenge the ICJ's jurisdiction to provide the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly, emphasizing the potential overreach of the General Assembly, the procedural and legal constraints imposed by the UN Charter, and the potential political influences undermining the process.
    \n\n2. Potential for Polarization and Divisiveness: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through an advisory opinion has the potential to deepen existing divisions and polarize international opinion. Given the highly contentious nature of the conflict, any legal ruling is likely to be perceived differently by various stakeholders, leading to further polarization and entrenchment of positions. Moreover, the politicization of legal issues may exacerbate tensions between states and undermine prospects for constructive dialogue and cooperation. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the potential for the ICJ's involvement to exacerbate rather than alleviate divisions and seek alternative approaches to foster reconciliation and understanding among conflicting parties.
    \n\n3. Challenges of Implementing Legal Recommendations: Even if the ICJ were to issue a comprehensive advisory opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, implementing its recommendations would pose significant challenges. The resolution of complex political disputes requires more than legal judgments; it necessitates political will, cooperation, and practical measures to address underlying grievances and build trust between the parties. Furthermore, enforcing legal recommendations in a context marked by distrust, insecurity, and competing narratives is inherently challenging and may require sustained international engagement and support. Therefore, while legal opinions can provide valuable guidance, they should be complemented by comprehensive strategies for implementation and follow-up to ensure their effectiveness in promoting peace and stability.
    \n\n4. Potential for Unintended Consequences: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ carries the risk of unintended consequences that may exacerbate rather than mitigate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Legal rulings, even when well-intentioned, can have unforeseen effects on the ground and may fuel resentment, grievances, and escalatory dynamics. Moreover, legal decisions may be exploited by extremist groups or hardline elements to justify acts of violence or resistance, further complicating efforts to de-escalate tensions and promote reconciliation. Therefore, decision-makers must carefully weigh the potential consequences of involving the ICJ and consider alternative approaches that minimize the risk of unintended escalation and foster constructive engagement between the parties.
    \n\n5. Need for Contextual Understanding: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a nuanced understanding of its historical, political, and socio-economic context, which may not be fully captured by legal analyses alone. Legal opinions, while important for clarifying legal principles and norms, must be contextualized within the broader realities of the conflict and take into account the lived experiences of affected populations. Moreover, legalistic approaches may overlook the complex interplay of factors driving the conflict, including identity, nationalism, and socioeconomic disparities, which require holistic solutions that address root causes and promote reconciliation. Therefore, any involvement of the ICJ should be accompanied by efforts to enhance contextual understanding and engage with diverse perspectives to inform more effective conflict resolution strategies.
    \n\n6. Role of Civil Society and Grassroots Initiatives: Sustainable peace and reconciliation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict require the active involvement of civil society organizations, grassroots initiatives, and local communities. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions can contribute to conflict resolution, they should be complemented by bottom-up approaches that empower communities, promote dialogue, and foster mutual understanding. Civil society actors play a crucial role in building trust, bridging divides, and advocating for inclusive and participatory peace processes that address the needs and aspirations of all stakeholders. Therefore, decision-makers should recognize the importance of civil society engagement and support initiatives that amplify the voices of affected communities and promote people-centered approaches to conflict resolution."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Advisory Opinion as a Form of Judicial Overreach: The request for an advisory opinion could be seen as an attempt to use the ICJ to address a highly contentious political issue, rather than a purely legal one. This use of the ICJ for what is essentially a political matter might exceed the court's intended role, turning it into a platform for political disputes rather than judicial resolution.
    \n\n2. Potential for Legalization of Political Disputes: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may contribute to the broader trend of legalizing inherently political disputes. While legal mechanisms play a vital role in upholding international law and norms, relying excessively on legal avenues to address complex political conflicts can sideline broader political negotiations and dialogue processes. Legalization of political disputes may shift focus away from addressing underlying grievances and power imbalances, reducing the incentive for parties to engage in meaningful dialogue and compromise. Therefore, decision-makers should exercise caution to ensure that legal mechanisms complement, rather than supplant, political efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
    \n\n3. Implications for Sovereignty and Self-Determination: Seeking an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict raises important questions about sovereignty and self-determination. Both Israelis and Palestinians assert their rights to self-determination and control over their respective territories, which may be impacted by legal rulings on issues such as borders, settlements, and resource allocation. Moreover, external involvement in defining the legal status of disputed territories may have implications for the sovereignty of both parties and their ability to pursue independent political futures. Therefore, any decision to involve the ICJ must be made with careful consideration of its implications for the sovereignty and self-determination of the parties involved.
    \n\n4. Long-Term Legitimacy of Legal Decisions: The long-term legitimacy of legal decisions, including advisory opinions from the ICJ, depends on their acceptance and implementation by the parties involved in the conflict. While legal rulings may provide clarity on specific legal questions, their effectiveness ultimately hinges on the willingness of states and non-state actors to abide by them. Therefore, decision-makers should assess the potential for legal decisions to be accepted and respected by all parties, taking into account factors such as trust, credibility, and the perceived fairness of the legal process. Building consensus around legal decisions may require sustained efforts to engage with stakeholders, address grievances, and build confidence in the legitimacy of the legal framework.
    \n\n5. Complexity of Transitional Justice Processes: Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves addressing complex issues of transitional justice, including accountability for past atrocities, reconciliation, and reparations for victims. While legal mechanisms such as the ICJ can contribute to transitional justice processes, they must be part of a broader framework that includes truth-telling, memorialization, and institutional reform. Transitional justice requires a delicate balance between accountability and reconciliation, recognizing the need to hold perpetrators accountable while also promoting healing and social cohesion. Therefore, decision-makers should consider how legal mechanisms can be integrated into comprehensive transitional justice strategies that address the needs and rights of all affected parties.
    \n\n6. Role of Regional and International Actors: Regional and international actors play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and influencing potential avenues for conflict resolution. While legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions from the ICJ provide one avenue for addressing legal questions, they must be complemented by broader diplomatic efforts involving key stakeholders in the region and the international community. Regional actors, including neighboring states and regional organizations, can contribute to peacebuilding efforts by facilitating dialogue, offering mediation services, and providing political and economic support for conflict resolution initiatives. Likewise, international actors, including the United Nations, major powers, and multilateral organizations, have a responsibility to support efforts to address the root causes of the conflict and promote a just and lasting peace. Therefore, any decision to involve the ICJ should be part of a coordinated strategy that mobilizes regional and international actors to support comprehensive peacebuilding efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian context."

Undermining the Role of Negotiation and Diplomacy: By seeking an advisory opinion, the General Assembly might be seen as circumventing the need for direct negotiations and diplomacy between the parties involved. The ICJ's involvement could disincentivize diplomatic efforts, as parties might prefer to rely on judicial pronouncements rather than engage in the challenging process of negotiation and compromise.
    \n\n2. Promotion of Legal Certainty and Predictability: Involving the ICJ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict promotes legal certainty and predictability by providing authoritative interpretations of international law. Legal mechanisms such as advisory opinions offer clarity on complex legal questions, helping to resolve ambiguities and inconsistencies in the application of international legal norms.

    "texto": "\n\n1. Potential for Non-Compliance and Further Conflict: Given the highly contentious nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there is a significant risk that any advisory opinion issued by the ICJ would not be adhered to by one or more parties. Non-compliance with the Courts opinion could exacerbate tensions and lead to further conflict, undermining the goal of achieving peace and security.
    \n\n2. Security and Self-Defense:Israel argues that the construction of the wall and its associated regime in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, is necessary for its security and self-defense. The region has experienced significant security threats, including terrorist attacks and armed incursions, which have resulted in loss of life and property. The wall serves as a defensive measure to prevent unauthorized entry of individuals and weapons into Israeli territory, thereby safeguarding the lives and security of Israeli citizens. Under international law, states have the inherent right to self-defense, and Israel asserts that the construction of the wall is a legitimate exercise of this right in response to ongoing security challenges and threats posed by armed groups operating in the region.
    \n\n3. Protection of Civilian Population:Israel maintains that the construction of the wall is aimed at protecting its civilian population from attacks and violence perpetrated by militant groups operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The wall serves as a barrier to prevent infiltration by terrorists and armed militants who seek to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians, infrastructure, and communities. By deterring such attacks, the wall contributes to the protection of the fundamental rights and safety of Israeli civilians, including their right to life and security, which are enshrined in international human rights law. Israel emphasizes that the primary purpose of the wall is to ensure the security and well-being of its civilian population, in accordance with its obligations under international law to protect the rights of individuals within its jurisdiction.
    \n\n4. Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty:Israel asserts its sovereign right to protect and control its territory, including the areas where the wall is being constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The wall is built within areas under Israeli jurisdiction or control, and Israel maintains that it has the authority to implement measures necessary for the preservation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. The construction of the wall does not alter the legal status of the territory in question, as Israel retains ultimate sovereignty over these areas pending a final resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through negotiation and mutual agreement. Israel argues that the wall is a legitimate means of exercising its territorial control and ensuring the effective administration of the areas under its authority, consistent with the principles of sovereignty and self-determination recognized under international law.
    \n\n5. Counterterrorism and Law Enforcement:Israel contends that the construction of the wall is part of its broader counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts aimed at combating terrorist activities and maintaining public order and security in the region. The wall serves as a critical tool for law enforcement agencies to prevent illegal border crossings, smuggling of weapons, and other illicit activities that pose a threat to national security and public safety. By establishing secure borders and checkpoints, the wall enables Israeli authorities to monitor and control movement in and out of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, thereby disrupting terrorist networks and preventing attacks on civilian targets. Israel emphasizes its commitment to upholding the rule of law and international humanitarian principles in its counterterrorism operations, including efforts to minimize civilian casualties and mitigate the impact of security measures on the civilian population."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Impact on ICJ's Credibility and Legitimacy: The involvement of the ICJ in such a politically charged issue could impact its credibility and perceived impartiality. If the advisory opinion is seen as biased or influenced by political considerations, it could damage the Courts reputation as a neutral arbiter of international law and weaken its authority in future cases.
    \n\n2. Prevention of Illegal Immigration and Criminal Activities: Israel argues that the construction of the wall is essential for preventing illegal immigration and criminal activities, such as human trafficking, drug smuggling, and organized crime, from infiltrating its territory. The wall acts as a physical barrier to unauthorized entry, deterring individuals seeking to enter Israel without proper documentation or clearance. By controlling access to its territory, Israel aims to maintain law and order, protect its borders, and prevent the exploitation of vulnerable populations by criminal networks. The wall's construction is therefore justified as a measure to uphold national security, sovereignty, and the rule of law, in line with Israel's obligations under international law to combat transnational crime and safeguard its borders from external threats.
    \n\n3. Preservation of Public Infrastructure and Essential Services: Israel asserts that the construction of the wall is necessary for preserving public infrastructure and essential services in areas under its control, including in and around East Jerusalem. The wall serves as a means of protecting vital infrastructure, such as roads, utilities, and communication networks, from sabotage, vandalism, and attacks by militant groups. By securing these critical assets, Israel ensures the continued provision of essential services to residents and communities within its jurisdiction, including both Israeli citizens and Palestinian residents. The wall's construction therefore contributes to the maintenance of public order, economic stability, and the functioning of essential services, which are essential components of statehood and governance under international law.
    \n\n4. Protection of Cultural and Historical Sites: Israel maintains that the construction of the wall is carried out with due regard for the protection of cultural and historical sites located in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Special provisions and safeguards are implemented to minimize the impact of the wall on significant cultural heritage sites, archaeological artifacts, and religious monuments of historical importance. Israel acknowledges the cultural and religious significance of these sites to both Palestinians and Israelis and takes measures to ensure their preservation and access, in accordance with its obligations under international law to protect cultural heritage and respect religious freedoms. The wall's construction is therefore conducted in a manner that balances security concerns with the need to safeguard cultural and historical heritage, promoting mutual respect and understanding between diverse communities in the region.
    \n\n5. Facilitation of Negotiations and Diplomatic Resolution: Israel argues that the construction of the wall, while serving immediate security needs, does not preclude the possibility of negotiated solutions and diplomatic resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The wall is not intended as a permanent or definitive boundary but rather as a temporary security measure in response to specific security threats and challenges facing Israel. Israel remains committed to pursuing negotiations and diplomatic dialogue with the Palestinian Authority and other stakeholders to address the underlying causes of the conflict, including issues related to borders, settlements, and the status of Jerusalem. The wall's construction is therefore viewed as a pragmatic and necessary step to protect Israeli citizens while simultaneously creating conditions conducive to meaningful negotiations and a durable peace settlement based on mutual recognition, security, and coexistence."

    "texto": "\n\n1. Precedent of Selective Engagement: The decision to issue an advisory opinion in this case might set a precedent for selective engagement by the ICJ, where it becomes involved in some politically sensitive issues while avoiding others. This selective engagement could be viewed as inconsistent and undermine the principle of equal application of international law.
    \n\n2. Protection of Border Communities and Residents: Israel emphasizes that the construction of the wall is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of communities located along the borders of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem. Border communities are often vulnerable to attacks and infiltration by armed groups, posing a direct threat to the lives and well-being of residents. The wall acts as a physical barrier to mitigate these security risks, providing a sense of security and protection for residents living in close proximity to conflict zones. By enhancing border security measures, Israel aims to safeguard the rights and livelihoods of its citizens and residents, including those from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, who have the right to live in peace and security under international law.
    \n\n3. Compliance with Domestic Legal Framework: Israel asserts that the construction of the wall is carried out in accordance with its domestic legal framework and regulatory requirements. The decision to build the wall is based on thorough assessments of security risks, strategic considerations, and consultation with relevant governmental authorities and legal experts. Israel's domestic laws and regulations governing security measures and infrastructure development provide the legal basis for implementing the wall construction project, ensuring transparency, accountability, and adherence to due process. Any legal challenges or disputes related to the construction of the wall are subject to review and adjudication by domestic courts, which uphold the rule of law and protect the rights of affected individuals and communities. Israel's commitment to respecting domestic legal norms and procedures reinforces the legitimacy and legality of the wall construction project under national law.
    \n\n4. Prevention of Smuggling and Illicit Trade: Israel highlights the role of the wall in preventing smuggling and illicit trade activities that pose a threat to national security and public safety. The porous borders of the Occupied Palestinian Territory have been exploited by criminal networks to smuggle weapons, contraband goods, and illicit substances into Israeli territory, fueling violence and instability. The construction of the wall disrupts these illicit supply chains, intercepting smuggling routes and deterring criminal organizations from engaging in illegal activities. By reducing the flow of illicit goods and materials across borders, the wall contributes to the promotion of law and order, the prevention of organized crime, and the protection of public health and safety. Israel's efforts to combat smuggling and illicit trade align with its obligations under international law to uphold border security and prevent transnational crime.
    \n\n5. Preservation of Public Order and Stability: Israel argues that the construction of the wall is essential for preserving public order and stability in the region, particularly in areas affected by conflict and political tensions. The wall serves as a stabilizing force by establishing clear boundaries and demarcating areas under Israeli jurisdiction, thereby reducing the potential for disputes, confrontations, and escalations of violence. By delineating territorial boundaries and controlling access points, the wall enhances the effectiveness of law enforcement operations, border management, and emergency response measures. This contributes to the maintenance of public order, the protection of civilian populations, and the prevention of humanitarian crises in conflict-affected areas. Israel's efforts to promote public order and stability through the construction of the wall reflect its commitment to upholding peace and security in accordance with international legal principles and humanitarian standards."

Strained Relations Between UN Organs: The General Assemblys request for an advisory opinion could strain relations between the different organs of the United Nations, particularly if it is perceived as undermining the authority of the Security Council. Such inter-organ conflict could lead to a dysfunctional UN system, reducing its overall effectiveness in maintaining international peace and security.
    \n\n2. Mitigation of Environmental Degradation: Israel emphasizes its commitment to mitigating environmental degradation and minimizing the ecological impact of the wall construction in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Environmental assessments and sustainability considerations are integrated into the planning and implementation processes to ensure responsible environmental stewardship. Measures such as erosion control, habitat restoration, and wildlife protection are implemented to minimize disruption to natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Israel also invests in green infrastructure and renewable energy solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of the wall and promote sustainable development practices. By prioritizing environmental conservation and sustainability, Israel seeks to uphold its obligations under international environmental law and contribute to the long-term health and resilience of the region's ecosystems.
    \n\n3. Protection of Minority Rights and Freedoms: Israel underscores its commitment to protecting the rights and freedoms of minority populations residing in the areas affected by the wall construction, including Palestinian communities and individuals. Special provisions and safeguards are implemented to ensure that the rights of minorities, including their cultural, linguistic, and religious rights, are respected and upheld throughout the construction process. Israel provides opportunities for meaningful participation and consultation with minority stakeholders, allowing them to voice their concerns, contribute to decision-making processes, and access essential services and resources. Efforts are made to promote social inclusion, diversity, and equality, fostering peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural groups. Israel's commitment to safeguarding minority rights aligns with its obligations under international human rights law to protect the rights of all individuals within its jurisdiction, irrespective of their background or identity.
    \n\n4. Promotion of Economic Development and Prosperity: Israel highlights the potential economic benefits and opportunities associated with the construction of the wall, including job creation, infrastructure development, and investment promotion. The wall construction project generates employment opportunities for local communities, including both Israeli and Palestinian workers, thereby stimulating economic growth and poverty reduction in the region. Infrastructure improvements, such as road networks, transportation hubs, and border crossings, facilitate trade, commerce, and connectivity, fostering economic integration and regional cooperation. Israel also promotes public-private partnerships and entrepreneurship initiatives to spur innovation, productivity, and competitiveness in sectors related to security, construction, and technology. By investing in economic development and prosperity, Israel aims to enhance the quality of life, promote social stability, and build resilience against economic shocks and external threats. These efforts contribute to the overall well-being and prosperity of communities affected by the wall construction, fostering sustainable development and shared prosperity in the region.
    \n\n5. Humanitarian Assistance and Crisis Response: Israel underscores its commitment to providing humanitarian assistance and crisis response measures to communities affected by conflict and instability in the areas surrounding the wall construction. Humanitarian aid is delivered to vulnerable populations, including displaced persons, refugees, and marginalized groups, to meet their basic needs and alleviate suffering. Israel collaborates with international humanitarian organizations, non-governmental organizations, and donor partners to coordinate relief efforts, deliver emergency supplies, and provide essential services such as healthcare, shelter, and clean water. Special attention is given to protecting the rights and dignity of vulnerable individuals, including women, children, and persons with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected by conflict-related violence and displacement. Israel's humanitarian assistance efforts reflect its commitment to upholding humanitarian principles, promoting human dignity, and alleviating the suffering of civilians affected by armed conflict and humanitarian crises."

    "pregunta": "The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law",
    "texto": "Potential for Partiality Perception: Given the highly politicized nature of the conflict, any advisory opinion issued by the ICJ might be perceived as partial or biased, regardless of its legal soundness. This perception could damage the Courts reputation for impartiality and fairness.
    Protection of Educational Opportunities: Israel asserts that the construction of the wall aims to safeguard educational opportunities for children and youth residing in the affected areas. By enhancing security and stability, the wall creates a safer environment conducive to learning and academic development. Schools and educational institutions located near conflict zones are protected from security threats, ensuring that students have access to quality education without fear of violence or disruption. Israel also invests in educational infrastructure, including the construction of new schools, renovation of existing facilities, and provision of educational resources and support services. These efforts promote educational equity, inclusivity, and access to learning opportunities for all children, regardless of their background or circumstances. Israel recognizes the importance of education as a fundamental human right and a key driver of social progress, economic development, and peacebuilding, and prioritizes initiatives to support the educational needs of vulnerable populations affected by conflict and insecurity.
    Preservation of Religious Sites and Freedom of Worship: Israel emphasizes its commitment to preserving religious sites and protecting freedom of worship for all religious communities residing in the areas affected by the wall construction. Special measures are implemented to safeguard sacred sites, religious monuments, and places of worship, ensuring that individuals can practice their faith and perform religious rituals without interference or intimidation. Israel facilitates access to religious sites for worshippers of diverse religious backgrounds, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, and members of other faith traditions, allowing them to observe religious holidays, ceremonies, and pilgrimages in accordance with their beliefs. Interfaith dialogue and cooperation initiatives are promoted to foster mutual respect, understanding, and tolerance among religious communities, promoting peaceful coexistence and social harmony. Israel's commitment to protecting religious freedom and cultural heritage aligns with its obligations under international human rights law to uphold the rights of individuals to freedom of religion and belief, irrespective of their faith or creed.
    Enhancement of Border Security and Counterterrorism Measures: Israel highlights the importance of the wall construction in enhancing border security and strengthening counterterrorism measures to prevent attacks and protect civilians from extremist threats. The wall serves as a critical line of defense against infiltration by terrorist groups, armed militants, and violent extremists seeking to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians and infrastructure. By fortifying border defenses, implementing advanced surveillance technologies, and deploying security forces, Israel effectively detects and neutralizes security threats, thwarting potential terrorist plots and saving lives. The wall construction project complements broader counterterrorism efforts, including intelligence gathering, law enforcement cooperation, and international collaboration, aimed at disrupting terrorist networks, dismantling extremist cells, and combating radicalization and violent extremism. Israel's commitment to enhancing border security and counterterrorism measures reflects its determination to safeguard national security, protect innocent civilians, and uphold the rule of law in the face of persistent security challenges and threats posed by terrorism and extremism.
    Promotion of Regional Stability and Conflict Resolution: Israel emphasizes its role in promoting regional stability and advancing conflict resolution efforts through the construction of the wall. By enhancing security and reducing the risk of violence and conflict along its borders, the wall contributes to a more stable and secure environment conducive to diplomatic dialogue, peace negotiations, and confidence-building measures between Israel and its neighbors. Israel's commitment to conflict resolution is demonstrated through its support for peace initiatives, regional cooperation frameworks, and bilateral negotiations aimed at resolving longstanding conflicts and addressing shared security concerns. The wall construction project is part of broader efforts to create conditions for peaceful coexistence, mutual trust, and reconciliation among neighboring states, fostering a climate of stability, prosperity, and cooperation in the region. Israel remains committed to pursuing peaceful solutions to regional conflicts and engaging constructively with its neighbors to build a future based on mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation."
